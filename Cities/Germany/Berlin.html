                            Germany's unified history and Europe's hope for peace. Commissioned by Prussian King Friedrich
                            Wilhelm II in the late 18th century, the structure stands out as a magnificent 12-column gateway
                            inspired by ancient Greek architecture. One of the most symbolic points separating the city's
                            west and east sides, this gate was also known as the border crossing between two worlds during
                            the Berlin Wall era.</p>

                            Germany's memory but on the entire world's. Built in 1961, it not only divided West and East
                            Germany but also became a symbol of the Cold War. When this concrete barrier, which had
                            separated families, lives, and freedoms for decades, fell in 1989, the fate of both Germany and
                            Europe changed.</p>
