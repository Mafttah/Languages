            <p>Everything was going well in all the cities. Peace prevailed. This included the Mal and Til cities as
                well. But one day, everything would change.</p>

            <p>Five years later, the city of Kam had begun to grow restless, its patience had run out. It recalled all
                its ambassadors from the cities and told them to inform their leaders to strengthen their defenses. When
                the ambassadors arrived at their cities, they reported what had happened, and the kings and queens began
                to prepare their defenses. Soldiers formed defensive lines against attacks from all directions.</p>

            <p>One week later, King Mak summoned General Mak to his side.</p>

            <div class="dialogue">
                <p><span class="speaker">King:</span> "General, launch the attack on the soldiers. I'm getting very
                    bored now. If you don't start the attack, I'll kill you and bring in a more daring general in your
                    place."</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dialogue">
                <p><span class="speaker">General:</span> "Yes, sir, I'm starting the attack, but who or which side will
                    we attack?"</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dialogue">
                <p><span class="speaker">King:</span> "We'll attack the lower side. Attack the edge of Lit city's common
                    need area, from Kem city's city side, and also, if you wish, you can attack a bit of the edge of
                    Bati city. I want to unite with those Kotsus and grow stronger, but deploy 500 thousand soldiers to
                    protect the upper side. Give them General Ercan, and he can also attack upward if he wishes."</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dialogue">
                <p><span class="speaker">General Tor:</span> "Yes sir, I'll do it right away."</p>
            </div>

            <p>And the general told the soldiers and the other general what the king had said and went to prepare for
                the attack.</p>

            <p>Two hours later, General Tor had begun the attack. As General Tor was heading to Lit city, he sent a
                lieutenant to Kem city. They began attacking Kem and Lit cities at the same time. They started killing
                people brutally. There were towers in front of them, but it didn't matter to them. They were handling
                them with missiles. After destroying them, they started running without caring about forests, mountains,
                or mines. Neither their own dead nor the enemy's dead mattered to them. Women, children, and the elderly
                were running away screaming, but it was no use. They continued to attack.</p>

                between the mountain and the tower and at the border), the Kamals continued to attack. They didn't know
                what stopping meant. Wherever they passed, they left neither living creatures nor houses.</p>

            <p>General Loksan and General Kipso gave the order to their soldiers: "Attack!" and Kem and Lit soldiers
                went to attack. Orak and Sem soldiers were still waiting.</p>

            <p>As the soldiers attacked, from the opposite side came the Kamals, toppling trees in the forest and
                attacking with missiles. Before they even faced each other, infantry and archer casualties had begun.
                The battle would take place in the plain; there was nowhere to escape on the sides. Everyone knew that
                the battle was to the death. Either they would lose and the Kamals would go where they were going, or
                they would win and push back the Kamals.</p>

            <p>And the battle had begun. Each Kamal was fighting with 5 infantry. But the swords had no effect. Because
                for the Kamals to die, they needed to be killed through the holes in the armor on their backs, but to
                hit them from behind they needed planes, and they hadn't arrived yet. The soldiers were holding out for
                now, but they definitely needed the plane request.</p>

            <p>Three days later... The battle was still continuing. Since the planes hadn't come, 5 infantry would
                surround 1 Kamal using the Sato tactic (3 infantry distract while 2 stab from the back to kill). This
                way, Kem soldiers had killed 1,000 Kamals, but 7 million infantry had died and 20 thousand tanks had
                fallen. Lit soldiers had killed 2,000 Kamals, but 14 million infantry had died and 40 thousand tanks had
                fallen. All the archers were still standing, but the planes still weren't there. The general was
                starting to get impatient. He called out to the commander.</p>

            <div class="dialogue">
                <p><span class="speaker">General Loksan and General Kipso:</span> "Commander, where are the planes?"</p>

            <p>And the archers set off.</p>

            <p>The infantry continued to resist. They had pinned their lives on the archers; they had lost hope in the
                planes. They were trying to kill the Kamals with the Sato tactic... Just as they were about to kill one
                more Kamal and retreat, bullets started raining down and the Kamals were dying. Everyone was shocked.
                Because the archers hadn't done this. The archers and other soldiers hadn't advanced further back yet.
                The planes had done this—they had finally arrived. They continued to rain bullets. The Kamals continued
                to attack, but their numbers were decreasing. The 2 commanders started looking for the general but
                couldn't find him. Because the general had died. Sweat began to run down the foreheads of both
                commanders. Both commanders shouted to the soldiers to retreat, and the Kamals began to retreat.</p>

            <div class="separator">⚔</div>

            <p>Three days later, the archers with the support troops had passed behind the Kamals from the forest and
                had started marching to attack. While marching, someone was running toward them. The archers prepared to
                shoot arrows and the commander started waiting for the fire command. But the commander didn't give the
                fire order. Because the one coming was one of their own, but there was a problem. Behind the soldier, a
                dust cloud was rising, and it was huge. When they looked more carefully, all the Kamals were coming
                behind the soldier. In fact, behind them, planes were flying and firing. A total of 200 of them (110 Lit
                planes, 90 Kem planes) had already fallen. The archer commander understood. They had won the battle, but
                every gain had a consequence. The commander asked for 2 pieces of paper from the archers and wrote
                something. He gave the 1st paper to the archer next to him and asked him to shoot it a little in front
                of the soldier, and the archer shot it. He gave the 2nd paper to the archer at the very back and said
                shoot when I say shoot. The archer nodded.</p>

            <p>The scout had passed them two days ago while the Kamals were resting. But one of them noticed him and
                alerted the whole army, and they went after him. An arrow fell 10 steps in front of the scout; he
                thought the archers had accidentally shot the arrow and picked up the arrow, but there was a piece of
                paper wrapped on the arrow. He opened the paper and read it. On the paper it said: "We saw you, don't
                come here, if you come here you'll die, drop yourself, brave soldier," and the soldier stopped and let
                himself be taken by the Kamals. Seeing this, the archers shouted "WHAT'S HAPPENING, WHAT'S HAPPENING,
                NO, NO," but it was too late; the Kamals had trampled over the scout. Now they understood, there was no
                way out from here, they couldn't kill them. Because their backs were turned. All the archers except the
                one holding the paper dropped their bows and arrows to the ground, opened their arms, and started
                waiting. At that moment, one Kamal separated from the herd.</p>

            <div class="dialogue">
                <p><span class="speaker">General:</span> "Soldier, report to the center what happened, have them send us
                    stones, wood, and planks for defense."</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dialogue">
                <p><span class="speaker">Soldier:</span> "Yes, general."</p>

            <div class="dialogue">
                <p><span class="speaker">General:</span> "Soldiers, fire missiles at the tanks, don't let them push us
                    too hard."</p>
            </div>

            <p>Missiles were coming toward the tanks, and the archers' fear was increasing. They were still running; the
                missiles weren't slowing them down. All the tanks had gone down. The commander was waiting for the right
                moment to shoot the arrow. The Kamals approached, approached, and the commander gave a signal. "Arrow
                ready, shoot toward the back of the Kamals," and the archer shot the arrow, and the Kamals started
                passing over them. Some they were killing with knives, and some they were trampling over. Above them,
                planes were still shooting, and Kamals were dying. After the last soldier died, the planes turned back
                to report after killing a few more Kamals. The Kamals started building walls with the planks and walls
                of the fallen tower and waited for the stones, wood, and planks to come from the center.</p>

            <p>Five days later, the upper troops had started clashing with the Kamals. They were trying to kill the

            <div class="separator">⚔</div>

            <p>The soldiers attacking from above were still fighting. 100 thousand Kamals had died, but 8 million
                infantry had died and 12 thousand tanks had fallen; the archers were still standing. They needed support
                now. Just when they thought it wouldn't come, sounds of "arararraahhahha" were coming from behind the
                Kamals. Help had arrived. The planes had also started raining bullets. They had ambushed the Kamals. All
                the Kamals were dying one by one. The general was shocked by what was happening; sweat was running down
                his forehead. While his soldiers were dying, he was thinking about what to do. He looked around; he was
                surrounded from 3 sides, only one side was open, and the idea of escaping from there came to his mind.
                But the direction he would go led to Sem city. He didn't want to be caught by soldiers while escaping
                from soldiers, but he had made up his mind to go in that direction. He was slowly going through the
                battle toward that direction. When he reached the opening, he called out to his soldiers. His soldiers
                had turned their heads both to the battle and to their general. After the general made sure all his
                soldiers were looking at him, he gave the order in their language with his hand gesture "THIS WAY" and
                all the Kamals left the battle and went in that direction, trampling over the infantry standing in front
                of them as they went toward Sem city. The soldiers were shocked—were they running away or was this a
                trap? They couldn't understand.</p>

            <div class="dialogue">
                <p><span class="speaker">First soldier:</span> "General, what are they doing?"</p>

                    them to leave the battle and catch up with us."</p>
            </div>

            <p>He calls out to another soldier.</p>

            <div class="separator">⚔</div>

            <p>While the 2 scouts were going to the battle on the other side, General Kalt was still trying to hold the
                Kamals. They had killed 100 thousand Kamals, but 8 million infantry had died, 40 thousand tanks had
                fallen, but the archers were alive. The planes were also continuing to rain bullets from the air. Seeing
                the 2 scouts coming, the general moved away from the battle to talk to them.</p>

            <p>As the general started to stagger, the 2 scouts held him so he wouldn't faint. The general decided to
                leave immediately. While the soldiers continued to fight, he called out to them. He shouted "RETREAT"
                and they started to retreat. He called one of his soldiers to his side.</p>

            <p>The army was ready to fight and started splitting in two to go right and left. The general (8 million

                the upper part because there are 2 mines protected by a tower above. The commander (8 million infantry,

            <p>And the soldiers come... They go to attack...</p>

            <p>The commander started walking down. His job was easy because there was no one to resist. He would take
                the mine, take a bit of area (I couldn't remember the name), and leave. He continued walking with the
                army. When he reached the border, he didn't stop and crossed the border. He was moving straight ahead. A
                few hours later, he saw the mine in front of him. He was now approaching the end.</p>

            <p>After surrounding the mine, there was a tower (and a mine, but they don't know because they didn't see
                it), but the tower wasn't seeing them, which made him even happier. After resting here for a few hours,
                he left a bit early and returned with the remaining soldiers and gave the good news to the queen.</p>

            <p>The general had also started walking, but his job was hard. Because there was a mine where he was going,
                and there was also a chance of entering war and losing. He had crossed the border. Two hours later, the
                mines and tower had appeared. He ordered the soldiers to attack, and they started running toward the
                tower. Of course, the tower had seen them and had gone on the counterattack... When the tower fell, part
                of the army (30 thousand infantry, 20 thousand archers had died, and 300 tanks had fallen) had also
                fallen. He might not be able to withstand it if there was a war. So he returned without waiting for the
                Kamals.</p>

            <p>The commander was waiting for the Kamals at the 2nd mine at the border, while the general positioned
                himself in the middle part of the mountain edge so he wouldn't be seen but could see those coming. Both
                started waiting.</p>

            <p>At that moment, the Kamal army was coming, but their numbers had decreased. Because while escaping, they
                had encountered 3 mines and 150 thousand Kamals remained. They were still running because the soldiers
                coming from behind were coming both for revenge and to save the city. Seeing this, the general informed
                the commander via radio.</p>

            <p>The Kamals passed the general and were advancing toward the commander. A while after they moved away, the
                general moved forward and took their positions. The Kamals hadn't noticed them; they could be
                comfortable. When they turned forward, a dust cloud was coming. They understood who was coming. The
                general warned the soldiers to be ready for battle.</p>

                with the 2nd Commander and start returning to the city with the remaining soldiers, but before that, the

            <p>While all this chaos was happening, Lit soldiers returned to the center. But while they expected applause
                for surviving, the general and king had gotten into a verbal fight. The commander was trying to silence
                the king, and a soldier was trying to silence the general. But when they gave a sharp and deadly look to
                those trying to hold them back, they stopped holding them. After a while, they fell silent and couldn't
                stand it and raised their hand. Seeing this, the soldiers reflexively aimed at the King. Seeing this, he
                had fallen silent. Sounds of "STOP, STOP, Don't do it" were coming from around.</p>

            <p>King: He wasn't giving up his stubbornness. But when he looked around, ambassadors, diplomats, all
                generals and commanders, and women were there. They were begging 'Please accept, don't put the city in
                difficulty.' The general's arm was starting to lower, but this was an arm lowering to fire.
                Understanding this, the king said:</p>

            <div class="dialogue">

            <p>While leaving, he glances at the king and gives intimidation by saying 'Chaos and rebellion' as he leaves

            <p>King Tal had started to get bored of this peace; now he wanted war. Sin had left him and he was looking
                for a city to attack; he had made up his mind, he would attack someone now... He had chosen the lucky
                city; he would attack Miki. After the selection was done, he summoned the general, commander, soldier,

                    1 tower. But of course, we must be careful while walking because we'll pass by the mud. Or we can

            <p>Everyone was looking at each other in fear. The king had lost his mind. Someone needed to handle this,

                toward the shore. Seeing this, the Lit soldiers on the dragons started flying quickly. The general on
                the ground told them to stop, but they didn't. They killed the dragons coming in front of them and
                continued to chase them. The general and commander came together at the place where the Bati soldiers

            <p>After the 2nd Commander and officer separated, the tanks on the shore had started engaging the dragons
                coming to shore. The dragon riders understood that this was a planned trap, but they had to deal with
                the tanks first. The commander had quickly moved to the beginning of the 2nd mine and the officer had
                moved to the middle of the 4th mine while the Lit general and commander were approaching the middle of
                the 4th mine. Just at that moment, an arrow falls in front of the Lit general and commander. Seeing the
                arrow, the general and those behind him raise their heads and look forward and upward. Where they
                looked, they saw dragons exhausted from tank fire, struggling to fly. Seeing this, the commander
                immediately went to the arrow and a note was attached to the arrow. He took the arrow, opened it, and
                looked inside. When he looked at the paper, his eyes opened wide. Seeing this, tension increased in the
                army. He raised his head and before he could say anything, while the dragons were falling one by one
                behind them, the wind reached the army. The commander made eye contact with the general and said 'It's a
                planned trap.' The general was about to say something when they were startled by a sudden attack sound
                from behind. They turned around and saw the Bati soldiers who had gone on the attack. The general
                immediately called a soldier to his side and wanted him to tell the King the situation and tell them to
                bomb here immediately because they won't be able to get out of here. Hearing this, the soldier's eyes
                filled with tears, but there was nothing to do, and he slipped away from the back of the 4th mine,
                moving away from the battle. The Lit army immediately started taking positions. The cavalry and soldiers
                moved forward, the archers lined up 2 steps behind them and waited...</p>

            <h2 class="chapter-title">Blood Will Come Out of Here, Not People. Unexpected Creatures</h2>

            <p>Two days later, the soldier sent by the general had arrived at the palace and urgently needed to see the
                king, but they weren't letting him talk to the king because the king supposedly had a meeting. They told
                the soldier to wait a few minutes, but he had neither a few minutes nor a few seconds. So he backed up
                4-5 steps, and when he saw the soldiers were fooled, he started running to the meeting room. The
                soldiers behind him were trying to catch him while shouting 'Stop Stop.' Finally, he burst into the
                meeting room and everyone looked at him. He was covered in blood and sweat. In the room were the King,
                queen, 2nd commander, 1 officer, 2 soldiers, and countless ambassadors. Finally, he made eye contact
                with the King in an anxious way. And in front of everyone, he shouted 'AMBUUUSH' to the King. Actually,
                he didn't want to shout, but his voice came out that way. Everyone in the room froze. Finally, the King
                pulled himself together, stood up, and while leaving said 'my room' to the arriving soldier, and they
                moved away from those in the room.</p>

            <p>When they arrived at the King's room, the King immediately told the soldier to explain what happened.</p>

            <div class="dialogue">
                <p><span class="speaker">Soldier:</span> "At first, we thought they were running away. The dragons
                    killed the enemy dragons in front of them and started chasing. The general said stop, but they
                    didn't. The general and commander also met at the place where they camped and started advancing. But
                    this was a trap. While the tanks were engaging the dragons, they were planning to attack us from
                    behind. The reason the general sent me here is a request he made from you, no matter what."</p>
            </div>

            <p>After the soldier said what he talked about with the general, the King couldn't believe what he heard and
                sat in the chair behind him. The soldier gave him a glass of water and asked the King how he was. Of
                course, the answer to the question was obvious. The King was bad. After the soldier left for the King to
                take a breath, the king immediately left the room and went to the place he always went in difficult
                situations, the dungeon. In the dungeon, there was once the best scientist. He had supposedly
                accidentally said but intentionally made an invention. That was a bomb similar to an atomic bomb with
                powerful force. The king had thrown him in the dungeon for finding it, but since it worked, he was being
                maintained.</p>

            <p>They make eye contact with the King and start talking:</p>

            <div class="dialogue">
                <p><span class="speaker">Scientist:</span> "What happened again?"</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dialogue">
                <p><span class="speaker">King:</span> "My general asked me for something and I came to consult you."</p>
            </div>

            <p>After the king told the general's request, he asked:</p>

            <div class="dialogue">
                <p><span class="speaker">King:</span> "So, what do you say? Should we destroy that place for the sake of
                    mines, or can I go and take them after they die?"</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dialogue">
                <p><span class="speaker">Scientist:</span> "A very interesting request. I don't know what to say. Let me
                    think... I think you should drop the bomb and be done with it. At most, what can happen, no one can
                    approach for 2-3 years, then you go and take them."</p>
            </div>

            <div class="dialogue">
                <p><span class="speaker">King:</span> "Okay, thank you. You'll be very well taken care of."</p>
            </div>

            <p>After the king left the scientist's side, he went to the soldier who had been waiting for him in the room
                and gave the order. DROP THE BOMB. The soldier immediately went and told the person in charge of this.
            </p>

            <div class="separator">⚔</div>

            <p>Three days later, the bombs had been placed on all planes and were ready. Everyone was waiting for the
                King's order. After the king went to the scientist's side one more time, he gave the order to fly and
                bomb, and the planes started flying toward the chaotic place. Ten hours later, the battle area started
                entering the field of view of the Lit planes. At that moment, all the soldiers in the battlefield had
                raised their heads to the sky. Seeing the planes, General Loksan started jumping with joy in the middle
                of the battle. Everyone started thinking the general had gone crazy when bombs started raining from the
                sky everywhere. Everyone started to run away. But it was too late; the planes had dropped all the bombs
                everywhere to eliminate any possibility of escape. After all the planes dropped their bombs and moved
                away, the pilot general pressed the button, and an explosion with the effect of an atomic bomb occurred
                from 105 thousand bombs. Everyone on the ground had died and 55 thousand of the planes had also
                perished. Just when they thought the mission was complete, three blue lights appeared in the exploded
                area and 3 different 30 creatures each emerged.</p>

            <div class="separator">⚔</div>

            <h3 class="section-title">Characteristics and Names of the Creatures:</h3>

            <div class="note">
                <p style="text-indent: 0;"><strong>1st Creature - Predator:</strong></p>
                <p style="text-indent: 0;">Characteristics: Flies. Very fast, becomes almost invisible. Has 2 heads.
                    Sees in all directions. Shoots poisonous feathers from its tail. Spits fire from its mouth. Only
                    dragons can kill it, but 5 dragons can kill 1.</p>

                <p style="text-indent: 0; margin-top: 15px;"><strong>2nd Creature - Armored:</strong></p>
                <p style="text-indent: 0;">Characteristics: On ground. Arms are 10 meters. Has 4 hands. Has axes in
                    hands and they're attached to hands with chains. Hard to approach. Can be killed with sword, arrows
                    don't work, fire doesn't work, but tank shells can damage its armor and if an arrow passes through
                    the damaged area, it dies.</p>

                <p style="text-indent: 0; margin-top: 15px;"><strong>3rd Creature - Crawler:</strong></p>
                <p style="text-indent: 0;">Characteristics: Unlimited field of view. Shoots arrows. Becomes invisible
                    while crawling, visible when shooting arrows. Dies if 3 tank shells hit its head.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="separator">⚔</div>

            <p>These creatures had died years ago, but now thanks to the dropped bombs, they were revived. As soon as
                they came to life, they started attacking the planes. Seeing this, some of the pilots started running
                around and some toward the city. The planes were falling one by one. 5 thousand planes managed to escape
                to the city, but they also had arrows. They didn't have much time either; planes were falling to the
                ground. Only one managed to land in the airspace; the others crashed to the ground while getting out of
                their planes. But the one who landed the plane also exploded 10 minutes after getting out of the plane.
                So there are 5 thousand pilots but no planes left.</p>

            <p>After landing in the city, the pilot whose plane exploded started running straight to the king's side.
                While the guards were trying to prevent him from running behind, he was advancing by bumping into
                everyone in front of him. When he arrived at the king's room, the guards at the door tried to stop him,
                but after he neutralized them, he burst inside. The king was at the window. When the door opened, he
                turned to the pilot whose warning sounds were rising from behind.</p>

            <div class="dialogue">
                <p><span class="speaker">Pilot:</span> "Creature zombies came to life."</p>
            </div>

            <p>After saying this, he fainted on the ground and took his last breath. Because one of the guards chasing
                him had accidentally shot him in the back. There was nothing to do; he had lost too much blood. They
                couldn't bury the pilot quietly because there were pilots all over the city saying 'CREATURE ZOMBIES,
                CREATURE ZOMBIES.' Hearing this, the king called one of his soldiers to his side and asked for a thick
                and protected wall to be built so they couldn't pass. Then he started the palace people to prepare for
                the announcement.</p>

            <p>One day later:</p>

            <div class="dialogue">
                <p><span class="speaker">King:</span> "Hey people, I know rumors have reached you, and I came to clarify
                    this. What you heard is unfortunately true; creature zombies have awakened."</p>
            </div>

            <p>(Haaa cries rise from the people)</p>

            <div class="dialogue">
                <p><span class="speaker">King:</span> "They're currently wandering around in the middle. But I assure
                    you, we'll kill them just like we killed them the previous time."</p>
            </div>

            <p>(Cheers of joy rise from the people)</p>

            <p>After the announcement ended, everyone dispersed. The king and his aides entered. One of the aides asked
                out of curiosity.</p>

            <div class="dialogue">
                <p><span class="speaker">Aide:</span> "But sir, our opponents are very strong. Don't forget our previous
                    battle. By the time we killed them all, all the cities had perished. It took 5 years to barely
                    recover. Yes, they're not an army now, but they're still very strong. Will we be able to give few
                    casualties?"</p>

            <div class="dialogue">
                <p><span class="speaker">King:</span> "We'll handle it somehow."</p>
            </div>

            <p>He says, and the moment the aide turns his back, he shoots him in the head. He says to the aide lying on
                the ground, "You ask too many questions." He calls the guards and asks them to burn the body. Then he
                goes to his chair and starts thinking...</p>

                million archers, 60 thousand tanks, and 30 thousand dragons. He would leave a small portion of the
                soldiers he brought with him as defense in the rear. After looking at the army and making sure they were
                ready, he sent the dragons ahead to burn the forest and return. After the sun advanced a bit, they
                started advancing. The dragons had done their job, and they could be seen returning a bit in the
                distance. The General also saw them and they headed forward to meet in the middle. As they advanced,
                they could hear the siren sounds coming from the city.</p>

            <p>Five hours later, the king and behind him 4 guards with weapons in their hands as if they would shoot
                people were coming to the headquarters. Everyone except 1 person had prepared. That person was Er
                Balzac. Balzac was always someone who prepared late. But today, it seemed he was deliberately preparing
                late. The reason for this was someone sent by Liki city to disrupt the place with a small confusion. The
                king and his 4 guards had approached, and Balzac still hadn't been able to prepare. Now, out of fear,
                those around him had started helping. The moment the king entered the headquarters, he had the General,
                commander, Er Tasku, and Er Maks kneel in front of the soldiers outside. He looked around, raised his
                hand, and started wandering inside the headquarters. Understanding this, the soldiers pointed their guns
                at the heads of those in front of them. While wandering, he saw Balzac and started walking toward him,
                but Balzac had also seen him. Just 10 steps before the king approached, he prepared and while turning
                back with tense joy, he shouted "I'm ready" and made eye contact with the King. At that moment, everyone
                else had collapsed on the ground from tension. Sounds of "Thank God" were coming from everyone. The king
                lowered his hand so they wouldn't kill them, but the guards misunderstood and killed them. Seeing this,
                the soldiers killed the guards, and the place had become a bloodbath. Everyone ran to the general and
                commander's side, but it was too late; both had died. Balzac had also panicked, but internally he
                couldn't believe it worked, saying "Stupid guards." The place was in chaos. Everyone in the city who
                heard the gunshot had gathered in front of the headquarters. Those who saw the incident were looking
                directly at the King. The king understood he needed to make an explanation.</p>

            <p>Three hours later, it was already evening, and Tal city had taken the mine and continued advancing.
                Everyone was waiting for the king to make an explanation, or the city would likely fall. The king
                finally came out.</p>

            <div class="dialogue">

            <p>And he goes inside... Everyone starts to disperse, but one person is still looking toward the palace.
                That person is Balzac. Thinking about his treacherous plans in his mind, he starts walking backward
                while laughing.</p>

            <p>The next day, Tal city's attacking soldiers had destroyed the mines and tower in front of them and
                continued on their way. After advancing a bit from the tower ruins, sounds started coming from ahead.
                Miki city had finally gone on the attack. Even after 2 mines and 1 tower, they still had more soldiers
                than Miki city. Both sides started fighting in front of the mine.</p>

            <p>Two days later, Lit soldiers were ready at the port. Only the soldiers guarding the palace for the king
                would protect the palace. The king had risked everything. He had fought with creatures once, and this
                war almost caused the destruction of all countries. He couldn't risk this again. After the final
                instructions were discussed, the soldiers left the port. They left only one ship for the king. One and a
                half days later, they had arrived at the Tiki port. There was no guard at the port. Luck had smiled on
                them for now. When they arrived at the port, they quietly got off their ships and waited for everyone to
                be ready. Then they started attacking by shouting loudly. After taking the mine, they went on the attack
                toward the 1st tower. The people in the tower had been late to respond, so the tower fell immediately.
                Seeing this, those in the 2nd tower immediately went on the attack, and the 5th person in the tower went
                down to the center and set off toward the center. But an archer who saw this shot his arrow at the
                messenger's head. There was no problem until they reached the 3rd tower. After also destroying the 2nd
                tower, they continued advancing. They were quickly moving toward the 3rd tower, but just at that moment,
                2 mines exploded at the same time. The soldiers who didn't die in the towers died here. But there was no
                wavering. Seeing this, the messenger in the 3rd tower quickly started running toward the palace. It was
                too far for the archers to shoot arrows. Half a day later, after also taking the 3rd tower, sirens
                started ringing in the city. They continued advancing. The first soldiers started running back from
                where they had camped so that the Tiki soldiers would step on the mines. Half an hour later, 2 explosion
                sounds came. The Tiki soldiers had swallowed the bait. Now it was time to run fast, but first the
                general ordered all the archers to shoot arrows at them and a bit further ahead. After shooting the
                arrows, they continued running. The Tiki soldiers were dumbfounded from the exploding mines. 2 Generals
                and the commander had died. The officer was left, but while trying to give orders to the soldiers, he
                also died with an arrow to his head along with 5 million infantry and 6 million archers. The Tiki
                soldiers were experiencing shock after shock. Finally, one soldier was smart and mounted one of the
                ownerless horses and went back to warn the king. The Lit soldiers took this freeze as an opportunity and
                continued attacking and shooting arrows. The Tiki tanks were trying to respond, but since the remaining
                soldiers weren't attacking, the soldiers in the tanks got out and started running away. When they came
                to the middle, the battle was progressing one-sidedly. The Tiki soldiers were trying to respond, but it
                wasn't working. Even the dragons were falling one by one. The Tiki soldiers were losing the battle. When
                the minds of the archers at the very back came together, they managed to escape back to their city, but
                all the dragons and infantry had died. They had seized the tanks. Since the Lit soldiers overcame the
                obstacle in front of them, they continued advancing. But their road was very long because in front of
                them were a lot of towers and mines.</p>

            <p>When the last remaining soldier arrived at the palace, he started running to the king's room, but 10
                guards coming from behind were shooting as they came because they couldn't figure out what was
                happening. Since they missed, they shot the 4 soldiers guarding the king's door. The soldier opened the
                door and shouted loudly "THEY DIED" and fainted on the ground.</p>

            <p>Two hours later, when he came to himself, he told everything that happened. Everyone who heard was in

                    mines and the tower, they were advancing toward the mine, but they heard a sound. A dust cloud was
                    rising from ahead. The general looked with binoculars to see what was in the rising dust cloud and
                    immediately the binoculars fell from his hand. When a soldier who approached his side asked what it
                    was, he could only say 'Crushers' quietly. When they decided to turn back, they were too slow. The
                    Crushers had seen them and were quickly coming upon them. The general sent one soldier to report to
                    the center and they tried to escape behind the mud puddle. But it was too late. The Crushers had

                    soldiers started fighting on two fronts. The soldiers started struggling, but they could still hold
                    out. Seeing this, one Miki soldier slipped away from the middle and started running upward. If the
                    whole unit above hadn't died yet, he would inform them, then go to the center and inform the queen.
                    The MiLi soldiers continued fighting, but they were struggling to fight on two fronts.</p>

                <p>One hour later, the group that left Mel city had crossed the border and taken the mine in front of
                    them. They were advancing without passing too close to the mud puddle. When they saw the first
                    tower, they started running making cheers. The soldiers in the tower saw them and started
                    shooting... The first tower had fallen and 2 mines had exploded, but they still continued advancing.
                    While the soldiers were advancing, sirens were ringing in the city, but since there was no one to
                    respond, they continued advancing without their attention being distracted. The 2nd tower had fallen
                    and the 3rd mine had also exploded. When they reached the 3rd tower, 9,520,000 infantry, 7,610,000
                    archers, 0 tanks and 3 thousand dragons remained, but there was no stopping.</p>

                <p>Then he says to 2 soldiers 'call the mining soldiers, have them find mine deposits for us' and
                    everyone disperses.</p>

                <p>Two hours later, the first group unit had set off to go to war. After also exploding and passing the
                    3rd mine, the 2nd group had also set off... The first group started advancing until something came
                    in front of them after passing the last mine. The 2nd group started walking upward toward Mel city
                    from the back. At this time, the Mel soldiers in Liki city had taken 2 mines, brought down 2 towers
                    and exploded 3 mines. After taking the next tower, they stopped at the mine deposit with 8,950,000
                    infantry, 7,160,000 archers and 900 dragons to rest. While the Mel soldiers were resting, the 1st
                    group Tiki soldiers were running but were still far away. While passing through the places they
                    passed, they were looking around and going; they could see the exploded mines and destroyed towers.
                </p>

                <p>Two hours later, the Tiki city could see the Mel city camp. In the darkness of the night, after
                    stopping, the general told the archers to shoot arrows toward the camp. After the archers shot
                    arrows, they continued advancing. The scouts who saw the arriving soldiers started blowing horns.
                    Just as they were blowing, the arrows had reached the camp. Some of the soldiers trying to exit the
                    tents had died. The soldiers were trying to regroup. The Mel dragons took off without soldiers and
                    started burning the infantry. But since they couldn't fight with both arrows and dragons at the same
                    time, they were falling one by one. The Liki scout soldier who saw the battle immediately returned
                    to the center.</p>

                <div class="separator">⚔</div>

                <p>While these were happening, the 2nd group Tiki soldiers had brought down 3 mines and 1 tower and were
                    continuing to advance. Sirens had started ringing in Mel city. The soldiers protecting the city
                    immediately went on the attack to respond. The Tiki soldiers had more numbers. Every time the Tiki
                    soldiers advanced, 1 mine exploded and the soldiers of both groups were flying into the air. The 2nd
                    mine had also exploded. The Mel soldiers were decreasing more and more. The fighting soldiers had
                    entered the tower range. The tower had started shooting arrows, but since the soldiers were mixed,
                    they were shooting arrows with their eyes closed. That's why both Mel and Tiki soldiers were dying.
                    But the Tiki soldiers were advancing without fear.</p>

                <p>Two days later, the Tiki dominion had incorporated Liki and Mel cities and had become a Dynasty.
                    Also, the Liki and Mel queens had fled and left their children behind. Because of this, 3 girls and
                    2 boys from Mel city and 3 girls and 2 boys from Liki city had come under the Tiki Dynasty. They
                    might be useful for the Tiki city's affairs in the future. The LiMi soldiers had taken Tal city, but
                    since Liki city fell, the Liki city soldiers had become a dominion together with Miki city.</p>

                    exploded 3 mines after taking the area up to the Tiki dynasty's border, they exploded 2 mines and
                    took the mine. Then they started fighting with the Kamals (1000 Kamals). Just at that moment, Sem
                    city had gone on the attack to Mac city. After taking 3 mines, before reaching the mine, they
                    started fighting with the Kamals (500 Kamals). Both sides were trying to push each other backward,
                    but the Bam soldiers were slowly going backward. Seeing this, one Bati soldier immediately left the

                <p>One day later, the soldiers had gone on the attack. After taking the 2 mines on the right side of the
                    mountain, while some of the soldiers were returning to the main soldiers who took 3 mines and
                    exploded 3 mines after taking the area up to the Tiki dynasty's border, they exploded 2 mines and
                    took the mine. Then they started fighting with the Kamals (1000 Kamals). Just at that moment, Sem
                    city had gone on the attack to Mac city. After taking 3 mines, before reaching the mine, they
                    started fighting with the Kamals (500 Kamals). Both sides were trying to push each other backward,
                    but the Bam soldiers were slowly going backward. Seeing this, one Bati soldier immediately left the
                    battle and started running upward to report the situation to Bati city. The Sem city had managed to
                    push the Kamals a bit and in fact had exploded the mine at their bottoms against the Kamals and
                    reduced the Kamals' numbers, but their work was still difficult.</p>

                <p>While the cities were fighting each other, Pon and Orak cities had bought soldiers without each
                    other's knowledge. Everyone knew that they were also preparing for war now. But they still had no
                    news from Tus city, but it was also quietly buying soldiers. But it wouldn't join the war; it would
                    attack to expand its territories. Meetings had started in the cities.</p>

                    attacked Pon city. After taking the first 3 mines and exploding the mine, they headed toward the
                    tower. Since it was an unexpected attack, the sirens had rung a bit late, but since they knew no
                    soldiers would come against them, they immediately took the 1 tower and 2 mines in front of them and
                    left people to check those coming from behind, then immediately headed to the battle.</p>

                <p>Half a day later, all of the Orak soldiers had died. The Pon soldiers had gathered with their troops
                    fighting in the city center by pushing the Kamals. In the battle, 600 Kamals remained; from Pon
                    soldiers, 70 million infantry, 40 million archers, 50 thousand tanks and 70 thousand dragons
                    remained. While the soldiers were clashing 10 km from Kama city's center, they heard the cheers of
                    BaKe soldiers from the right side of the battlefield, and BaKe soldiers had joined the battlefield.
                    The soldiers were mixed together. The Kamals couldn't distinguish the soldiers. The place had turned
                    into a pool of blood. Dust was flying into the air. No one could see who they were fighting. Just at
                    that moment, planes were passing from above. They were shooting rockets downward. The BaKe and Pon
                    generals were looking at their own majors. Because they hadn't called these planes. All the soldiers
                    were slowly dying. They were trying to escape, but they couldn't. 1 soldier had seen the plane's
                    flag, but he died before he could report. The planes were Tiki soldiers' planes. Some of the Tiki
                    soldiers were also slowly coming. 1 Pon soldier and 1 BaKe soldier hid separately among the rocks.
                    All the Kamals and soldiers had died. Seeing this, the Tus soldiers inside the mountain camped where
                    they were and sent 1 soldier to Orak city to ask for help from the Kamals and another soldier to the
                    palace to explain what happened. Just at that moment, the arriving BaKe soldiers also fled back.</p>

                <p>One day before, the Kamals were advancing in Orak city. After taking the first mine, they sent 8
                    Kamals ahead at different times and started advancing. When the first mine exploded, sirens had
                    started ringing in the city, but since no one was coming to attack, they were advancing comfortably.
                    The Kamals had exploded 8 mines one by one. They had also taken the 2nd mine. While fighting with
                    the tower in front of them, a soldier came to their side.</p>

                        you clap your hands 3 times, you can use them; to return to your normal state, clapping once is
                        enough. Also, if you're torn apart, you'll turn back into soldiers and can turn into a complete

                <p>The teleportation device above them had started working. When it reached 85%, the Witch started
                    speaking again.</p>

                <div class="dialogue">
                    <p><span class="speaker">Witch:</span> "Before you go, there are a few small tips I want to say. But
                        I can only say words, unfortunately."</p>
                </div>

                <p>It had become 90%. The witch had little time to say; the generals were throwing themselves at the
                    thing preventing them to break the chair protection. When it became 98%, the Witch used the words
                    'Tiki, surprise, there.' and added 'pay attention to the 3 empty spaces at first, then the side
                    where the door is, and learn something like martial arts' and the generals were teleported. The
                    witch was left alone. Now it was time to sleep until the next prophecy. Before falling asleep, she
                    said 'They'll need to work hard for 2 years and the process after that will be difficult for them'
                    and fell asleep.</p>

                <p>One week later, the generals had woken up. They remembered everything. They had to warn the king
                    immediately. The Sem, Tus, Orak, Pon, Bati, Kem and Tiki generals went to their kings-queens' sides.
                    When they opened the door, everyone in the room was in shock. They couldn't believe what they saw.
                    They all asked their generals the same question: 'Where have you been for 1 week? We thought you
                    were kidnapped. Just because of this, all the soldiers in the empty area, whether many or few, will
                    have a fight to the death in 2 hours.' The generals immediately explained what happened to them. The
                    robots, a situation about Tiki city, the existence of other cities mentioned in the legend, and
                    finally they asked the most obvious question: 'Do your arms or legs hurt from stretching?'</p>

                <div class="dialogue">
                    <p><span class="speaker">King-Queen:</span> "I saw what you told me in my dream."</p>
                </div>

                <div class="dialogue">
                    <p><span class="speaker">Generals:</span> "It wasn't a dream. I personally experienced it.
                        Everything was real. Your children were on the lava pipes, the majors were tied with poisonous
                        arrows aimed at their heads, weren't they?"</p>
                </div>

                <p>King-Queen: Their eyes started opening.</p>

                <div class="dialogue">
                    <p><span class="speaker">King-Queen:</span> "General, immediately go to the battle with a white flag
                        and bring the army here immediately. We have a lot of work."</p>
                </div>

                <p>Except for the Tiki general, the generals said:</p>

                <div class="dialogue">
                    <p><span class="speaker">Generals:</span> "We need to go to Tiki Dynasty. You start the procedures
                        for the robots; I need to warn them."</p>
                </div>

                <p>Taking 10 soldiers with them, they set off.</p>

                <p>Two days later, the last to arrive was the Tus general. When he arrived at the palace, complete chaos
                    reigned in front of the palace. The generals had white flags in their hands, but the guards were
                    holding them on the stairs in front of the door because in front of the door, Tiki Prince Voz had a
                    gun pointed at the Tiki general's head. The Tus general shouted toward the prince, but the prince
                    didn't even turn his head. Toward the General:</p>

                <div class="dialogue">
                    <p><span class="speaker">Prince:</span> "My city is safe; what happened was a dream. I don't trust
                        you. Soldiers, prepare your weapons; when I give the order, kill them all."</p>
                </div>

                <p>Hearing this, the Tus general immediately turned around and made eye contact with 2 archers.</p>

                <div class="dialogue">
                    <p><span class="speaker">Tus General to archers:</span> "Let your arrows pass by his head."</p>
                </div>

                <p>The prince had started counting down from 3 with his hand. When he reached 1, 2 arrows had passed by
                    both sides of his head. Everyone was looking in the direction the arrows came from. The prince made
                    eye contact with the general. The general said to the prince:</p>

                <div class="dialogue">
                    <p><span class="speaker">General:</span> "You grew up learning these. You could have asked your
                        father. If these are going to happen, we shouldn't grow, or why aren't we informing others,
                        things like that."</p>
                </div>

                <p>And while saying these words, he was walking toward the prince.</p>

                <div class="dialogue">
                    <p><span class="speaker">General:</span> "I don't know why you couldn't convince your father, but
                        when you came to power, your first duty was to listen to the officer who told you to buy
                        soldiers (while saying this, he was looking at the officer who said this) instead of mines. You
                        knew these were going to happen. Why didn't you prepare us or your own soldiers for this
                        situation?"</p>
                </div>

                <p>And he stopped in front of the prince. The prince's hand was trembling. The general could see the
                    tears in the prince's eyes. The moment he took the gun from his hand, the prince fell on his knees
                    and started crying. Crying:</p>

                <div class="dialogue">
                    <p><span class="speaker">Prince:</span> "He convinced me that such things wouldn't happen, and I
                        wanted to believe it. That's why I only went to grow. Please help."</p>
                </div>

                <p>And he extended his hand to General Kip. The general said 'we came here for this' and shook the
                    extended hand and helped the prince stand up. The prince wiped his tears and said:</p>

                <div class="dialogue">
                    <p><span class="speaker">Prince:</span> "We must get to work immediately. We must do 2-3 times what
                        the witch told you. Everyone go to the city and do whatever is necessary. If anyone attacks each
                        other during this process, I don't listen to prophecies or anything, I'll attack, be informed.
                        NOW GO!!!! I need to change the center's location."</p>
                </div>

                <p>While all the generals were preparing to leave from Tiki city, lightning started falling on Til city.
                    Although the sounds were far away, everyone could hear them. Everyone was looking at each other, and
                    'Whatever will happen will happen soon' was passing through their minds. The last to leave the city
                    was the Kem general. He looked back, made eye contact with the prince, mounted his horse, and set
                    off toward the city with the soldiers who came with him.</p>

                <div class="separator">⚔</div>

                <p>Two years later, Til city had been razed to the ground. Tons of infantry and archers ready to fight
                    were roaming the cities, and they had sent back the tanks and dragons. The robots were ready. The
                    witch had told them to make 10 robots to prepare them, but they had made 20... The scouts in Mik
                    city were on alert for any situation. Suddenly something happened. Although it was still early
                    morning hours, there was a movement in the atmosphere. Round balls were falling toward the earth.
                    The 2 scouts were looking at each other.</p>

                <div class="dialogue">
                    <p><span class="speaker">1st Scout:</span> "We weren't told there would be a meteor shower today. Do
                        you think we should report?"</p>
                </div>

                <div class="dialogue">
                    <p><span class="speaker">2nd Scout:</span> "Interesting. I think we should go and look."</p>
                </div>

                <p>The meteors were falling toward the seashore of the destroyed Til city. After the soldiers took 2
                    steps, they felt a kind of shaking. At first, they thought it was an earthquake, but when they
                    raised their heads, they saw big shadows among the dust clouds. Even from where they were, they
                    could understand what they were. They couldn't count how many there were, but there were many. Both
                    scouts started running toward the city. Just at that moment, sirens had started ringing. When they
                    arrived at the palace, the only person who would report, the soldier who would use the train track,
                    was ready to leave, and he had a lot of blue fire-lighting torches in his hand. The king was
                    shouting 'Hurry up and go and report.' And to the soldiers, he was giving the attack order. He was
                    shouting "THEY CAME, THEY CAME." The witch had told the truth; they really came.</p>
            </div>

            <!-- THEY CAME DIVIDER -->
            <div class="part-divider">
                <h2>They Came</h2>
            </div>

            <!-- THEY CAME CHAPTER 1 -->
            <div class="chapter">
                <div class="chapter-number">Chapter 1</div>
                <h2 class="chapter-title">Acidic War</h2>

                <p>The soldier who got on the single-person train had come to the middle of Tiki city. The prince who
                    got the news told his soldiers: if you move the city in 2 days, I'll give you more salary, and pile
                    tons of soldiers at the border. Attack in human form the moment you see movement in the sea.</p>

                <p>After saying this, the soldiers came to life and started accelerating. The soldier on the train was
                    still shouting 'THEY CAME, THEY CAME.'</p>

                <div class="separator">⚔</div>

                <p>Three days later, the giant robots had crossed the border of Mik city. The king was in stress. He
                    still hadn't given the attack order. There was chaos inside the room. The king had stood up. Just as
                    he was about to speak, a sword stabbed into his heart from behind. When he collapsed on the ground,
                    he made eye contact with his eldest son (Prince Baw). His son whispered in his ear 'We can't wait
                    for you anymore, SENILE' and closed the king's eyes and left him to die. Turning to those inside:
                </p>

                <div class="dialogue">
                    <p><span class="speaker">Prince Baw:</span> "Attack!"</p>
                </div>

                <p>And the generals immediately left the room.</p>

                <p>One hour later, the giant robots had reached halfway through the city. The general and behind him
                    hundreds of thousands of soldiers were slowly starting to turn into robots. They had heard the
                    trumpet sound from behind and started running against the giant robots. The battle had started. The
                    robots were clashing, but their numbers were too many, and meteors continued coming. The soldiers
                    were communicating with headsets. There was a soldier who was detecting what level the robots were,
                    and he was calling out to them 'These are level 1.' Even though they were level 1, they were dying
                    hard. The general was cutting the robots with flaming swords in his hands, but more was needed.
                    Calling out to the very back: bring those with red pills. Planes had taken off from the city. They
                    were flying over the robots. The soldiers thought the robots couldn't reach them, but from the very
                    back of the robots, some were turning into dragons and coming toward them, and there were also
                    robots sending beams forward. The soldier said these were level 2. Some planes hadn't seen the
                    incoming beams and exploded together with the soldiers inside, but the 20 soldiers inside the other
                    10 planes managed to escape from the beam and started falling to 10 different points. Seeing this,
                    the general told via headset for those with blue pills and some soldiers to be ready with explosive
                    bombs. The soldiers with tank features had fallen to the ground and formed a round circle. They
                    weren't taking damage from the robots hitting them because of the shields they were using. They had
                    opened the portal to the ground. Seeing this, the soldiers jumped through the portal for their
                    pills. When they came out on the other side, they quickly started tearing apart the robots. They
                    were throwing bombs and cutting. Things were going quite well in the front, but when the general saw
                    the back, he saw a light explosion. Spears were coming. The soldiers hadn't seen this. The soldiers
                    at the very back were dying one by one, and they were sending beams to the tanks, exploding them.
                    The soldier determining levels hadn't seen them. He called out via headset:</p>

                <div class="dialogue">
                    <p><span class="speaker">Soldier:</span> "Where are the 20 robots we made with our own hands? We
                        need them urgently. We can't advance to the back."</p>
                </div>

                <p>Hearing this, the prince had sent 5 robots forward.</p>

                <div class="note" style="background: #ffe6e6; border-left: 4px solid #e74c3c;">
                    <p style="text-indent: 0; font-weight: bold;">These robots:</p>
                    <p style="text-indent: 0;">Robot: Durable armor, continuously discharges armor-piercing bullets

                    <p style="text-indent: 0;">Robot: Agility, has sword (died)</p>
                    <p style="text-indent: 0;">Robot: Armored, can roll, can create earthquake with hammer in hand and

                    <p style="text-indent: 0;">Robot: Can send small exploding balls and robots can't detect these balls
                        much</p>
                    <p style="text-indent: 0;">Robot: Has explosion power. Its armor can't be easily pierced. When it
                        takes enough damage, it explodes and gives electricity to those around it</p>
                </div>

                <p>The planes were bringing the robots. Seeing this, the general had given the forward order to the
                    soldiers. He was trying to send more soldiers with red pills to the back, but after the 6th point,
                    the planes were struggling to advance. Help from other cities had to come immediately. The 5 robots
                    that came to help had come to the general's side. The 5 robots jumped into the portal together to
                    open the way and found themselves exactly where they wanted to be. The desire to fight prevailed;
                    paying attention to spears and beams, they were attacking whatever came in front of them. After
                    bringing down one robot on its knees, they didn't see the coming robot, and with the robot's
                    rock-like foot hitting his face, he flew 10m. While trying to come to himself, a lot of robots had
                    piled on top of him. He couldn't move. He had lost the electricity-giving feature in his hands, and
                    the robots weren't allowing his head to turn. They had torn off his hands. Just as a robot was about
                    to step on his helmet, a bullet hit the robot's head. Then suddenly large eagles started falling on
                    them and grabbed the robots one by one and threw them to the ground. The general had returned to
                    human form. He looked back and saw General Matrak running with red torches in his hand. But he
                    wasn't completely robot. He was half eagle, half robot. He had wings. Behind General Matrak, a lot
                    of 20m tall rhinos were running. He could see the planes coming to help. He had turned back into
                    robot form. The soldiers had reached the 7th region. They were slowly approaching. Thinking about
                    what to do, he looked to the very back and his eyes suddenly opened. Because one robot was
                    connecting robots to each other. It had made 5 robots of 40m height with wings, laser beams and
                    spears. And they also had 6 arms, and in their hands were spears with ropes that could return to
                    themselves. Seeing these, the general immediately called out via headset to send soldiers to the
                    back, saying we're struggling here. At the back, one of the soldiers immediately swallowed the red
                    pill and opened the portal 5 meters in front of the general. The soldiers were swallowing red and
                    blue pills and jumping into the portal and joining the battle. The prince gave orders to the
                    soldiers with green pills, and the soldiers started running toward the battle. As the soldiers
                    turned into robots, they were launching rockets. The soldier determining levels was getting strange
                    signals.</p>

                <div class="dialogue">
                    <p><span class="speaker">Soldier to General:</span> "A strange signal is coming from the back; I

                <p>The prince sent 5 more robots to the 5th region via portal.</p>

                <p>The robots had joined the battle via portal. With the arriving robots, they had passed the 8th
                    region. All the level 1 robots had died. In front of them were level 2 and combining robots. The
                    soldiers were advancing. The 1st robot, 3rd robot and 8th robot were advancing at the very front.
                    The incoming lasers weren't working on them. The 6th robot and 2nd robot were wandering around the
                    middle. They were taking space to attack. The 4th robot had started throwing small balls. The
                    combining robots were taking damage, but they weren't taking much damage. They were destroying the
                    incoming robots by throwing spears and beams. The spear-throwers' distance to the robots was 10m. At
                    that moment, the invisible robot was closer. It was approaching from the right side. The agile robot
                    was approaching from the left side, but they could see it. Soldiers were still coming from behind.
                    Generals Ops and Matrak were coming a bit further back. They were sending lasers, spikes and small
                    exploding balls toward the spear soldiers. The spear robots were riddled with holes, but they were
                    still alive. While they were sending lasers against each other, they were trying to escape from the
                    lasers, but it wasn't working; each one was dying one by one. After the last spear-thrower died, the
                    shield soldiers separated from each other. They had saved General Kipso. Just as they were about to
                    celebrate, the ground started shaking. Generals Lap and Plank were continuing to run without caring
                    what was happening. They had 10m left to the beam. They had approached. They jumped toward the beam.
                    Both had started burning in red. Just as they were about to land, 2 winged ones grabbed them by the
                    arms and started taking them far away. Suddenly, the ground started shattering. Something no one
                    knew came out from underground. This was a 30m spiky rolling, flying, flame-spewing and when it hit
                    the ground with its tail, it could kill everyone around it—a dinosaur robot.</p>

                <p>Four days later, the soldier who got on the single-person train had come to Bati city. While passing
                    through the city with a blue flare, meteors had started falling to the ground around the 2nd region.
                    Tiki soldiers and General Lap were ready at the border. Half of the Kem and Bati soldiers, Generals
                    Kipso and Plank were slowly walking toward the center from the sea. The meteors had ended. At the
                    exact center of where they fell, there was a level 3 robot, around it level 2 robots walking toward
                    both sides, and a few level 1 robots. Also, there was a box next to the level 3 robot. This time,
                    everyone had plugged their ears. What happened in Mik city had been a lesson for them, but Mik city
                    was still resisting. The Tiki army, under the general's leadership, was slowly starting to cross the
                    border. While crossing the border, the Bati and Kem armies had come out from the sea to shore. The
                    soldiers had surrounded the robots from 2 sides. The soldiers had started running toward the robots.
                    The robots were also walking toward them. The battle had started. Everyone was clashing with each
                    other. The generals were slowly coming from behind. The soldiers using red pills were passing
                    through the portal and going forward. While the Tiki soldiers were advancing, the soldiers coming to
                    battle continued to come out from water to shore and cross the border. The level 3 robot took the
                    box next to it and raised it into the air. From inside the box, a beam started rising into the air
                    and surrounding the area. Seeing this, millions of soldiers from the sea and border started running
                    quickly. 500,000 soldiers (Total BaKe soldiers and Tiki soldiers) had passed. The rest either died
                    from the beam or remained outside the border. Inside, from the BaKe cities, 1.5 million soldiers,
                    Generals Kipso and Plank, from Tiki city, Generals Lap, Şik and 2 million soldiers had entered. The
                    soldiers were still fighting. While advancing toward the center, they were killing the robots, but
                    they couldn't resist the incoming lasers. General Kipso had to do something. He asked the other
                    generals what their powers were, and an idea came to his mind. He called out to all the soldiers and
                    generals via headset.</p>

                <div class="dialogue">
                    <p><span class="speaker">General Kipso:</span> "I have an idea, but it's very dangerous. I have the
                        power to bring back the dead. I can bring everyone on this ground back to battle, but..."</p>
                </div>

                <div class="dialogue">
                    <p><span class="speaker">General Lap:</span> "BUT!!!! But what? SOLDIERS ARE DYING, WHATEVER IT IS,
                        SAY IT QUICKLY!!"</p>
                </div>

                <div class="dialogue">
                    <p><span class="speaker">General Kipso:</span> "I can bring back everyone who died, but if I do
                        this, the creatures our soldiers gave their lives to kill years ago will come back."</p>
                </div>

                <p>(A long silence occurred, and a soldier spoke.)</p>

                <div class="dialogue">
                    <p><span class="speaker">Soldier:</span> "Do whatever is necessary, general. We're in a difficult
                        situation here. I'm one of the soldiers at the very front and they were slaughtering us."</p>
                </div>

                <p>And the connection was cut.</p>

                <p>Hearing these words, General Kipso stopped where he was and tried to bring out the power inside him.
                    Suddenly, a red light formed around him. He opened his eyes, and his eyes were flame red. Seeing
                    this, General Plank called out via headset to the Tiki generals to send more soldiers. General Lap
                    turned around and told whoever had blue and green pills to drink them and attack—this equaled
                    800,000 soldiers. He told the remaining soldiers, whoever had red pills, to drink them, jump through
                    the portal and go as far forward as they could—this equaled 400,000 soldiers. While the soldiers
                    were turning into robots and running toward the battlefield, General Kipso kneeled on the ground and
                    touched the ground. The moment he touched the ground, shaking like an earthquake started. No one
                    could stand in balance. Zombie robots and creatures started coming out. They were attacking everyone
                    they saw, but mostly the soldiers. Seeing this, General Plank shouted 'Kipso.' General Kipso was
                    struggling to direct the soldiers. The red light around him started burning a bit stronger. The
                    creatures suddenly stopped and started turning toward the general. The general was sending them some
                    kind of signal. The creatures and zombies suddenly turned their heads toward the center and started
                    attacking. The robots were shocked. They were slowly retreating and dying. They were all starting to
                    gather in places. Generals Plank and Lap immediately started running. The plan was clear. General
                    Lap would go to the middle of where the robots were and pull everyone to himself, and General Plank
                    would jump toward that area and send electricity to everyone in the area. Seeing them running,
                    General Şik immediately got to work to open their way. He was shooting at whoever was in front of
                    them. Then suddenly a light explosion appeared in his eye. Beams were coming toward General Kipso
                    from 10 level 2 robots. Just as he was preparing to shout to the general, the soldiers had acted
                    before him. With teleport, they formed four rows of tens in front of the general. The laser came and
                    killed everyone up to the last row. New ones had come in place of the dead soldiers, but they
                    couldn't keep doing this. Both generals were also running with the soldiers. They could see what was
                    happening, but the only thing they could do was run a bit faster. The soldiers were meeting the
                    robots coming toward the generals, and General Şik was also supporting from behind. Then the 10
                    laser-shooting robots suddenly started flying toward General Kipso and his guards. General Şik had
                    noticed them, but there was nothing he could do. The number of creatures and zombie robots was
                    starting to decrease, but they continued fighting. The spear robots had approached General Kipso. In
                    front of him, a lot of soldiers were forming a shield, but how long could they hold out? They were
                    throwing their spears as they came. The shield soldiers were dying one by one, but the robots had a
                    small surprise for them. They opened teleport a bit further back of the robots. Warriors started
                    coming out from there. Seeing this, the spear robots turned backward. Their minds were confused. The
                    warriors were very fast. They cut their wings so they couldn't fly. Now everything was equal. Seeing
                    this, the shield soldiers closed their surroundings so there would be no gaps. The spear-throwers
                    were trapped. They couldn't get out, but warriors could enter inside. A lot of warriors had entered
                    inside. The inside was small, but they could move. The warriors were fighting with the
                    spear-throwers. Until the incoming help was cut off, they killed 4 spear-throwers inside. The
                    spear-throwers couldn't hold out any longer. Throwing their spears wasn't working. They also started
                    sending lasers. They were continuously sending lasers, but it wasn't working. Each laser was
                    bouncing off the shields one by one. They were trying to escape from the lasers, but it wasn't
                    happening; each one was dying one by one. After the last spear-thrower died, the shield soldiers
                    separated from each other. They had saved General Kipso. Just as they were about to celebrate, the
                    ground started shaking. Generals Lap and Plank were continuing to run without caring what was
                    happening. They had 10m left to the beam. They had approached. They jumped toward the beam. Both had
                    started burning in red. Just as they were about to land, 2 winged ones grabbed them by the arms and
                    started taking them far away. Suddenly, the ground started shattering. Something no one knew came
                    out from underground. This was a 30m spiky rolling, flying, flame-spewing and when it hit the ground
                    with its tail, it could kill everyone around it—a dinosaur robot.</p>

                <p>Four days later, the soldier who got on the single-person train had come to Tus city. While passing
                    through the city with a blue flare, meteors had started falling to the ground around the 3rd region.
                    Generals Kala, Kil, Baz, Kap, Tiz, Şont and Kip with their soldiers were slowly walking toward the
                    center. At the center, there was a lot of spear robots, a level 3 robot, and next to it, there was
                    also 1 box.</p>

                <p>The battle had started. General Kap was waiting on alert. His eyes were always on the box, but at the
                    same time, he was also fighting. Next to him was General Baz. In front of them were soldiers helping
                    their advance. General Kip was wandering around. He was slowly advancing toward the box. Generals
                    Tiz, Şont and Kala were advancing together using their special powers. General Kil was taking down
                    the dangers coming for General Kip from behind.</p>

                <p>One day later, the soldier who got on the single-person train had come to Sem city.</p>

                        awakened 2 dinosaurs from the depths. In the 3rd region, the battle just started."</p>

                <p>The general and major, after bidding farewell to the officer at the shore, turned into robots with
                    the soldiers who would come with them, stepped toward the water, and the water started rising.
                    Seeing it was safe, the other soldiers stepped toward the water. Then as the water went forward, it
                    started rising more and became a 40m tsunami. From the top of the tsunami, he could see the
                    battlefield and the dinosaur robot coming from behind, knocking down the trees.</p>

                <div class="separator">⚔</div>

                <p>The number of robots was starting to decrease. The generals had approached the center. Seeing this,
                    the level 3 robot started leaning toward the box next to it. Seeing this, General Kap stopped
                    fighting and immediately ran to steal the box, but the level 3 robot had noticed this and made eye
                    contact with the general. Seeing this, the general changed his direction and started running in a
                    way to create a 10m diameter vortex to confuse the robot's mind. General Kip had also joined the
                    incident. He had entered the vortex. He was about to take the box when the robot grabbed him by the
                    throat and lifted him up. Seeing this, General Kap stopped making the vortex** and ran to help
                    General Kip, but it didn't work because the robot had also grabbed him and lifted him into the air.
                    The robot was draining both their souls. The vortex was slowly disappearing. They were trying to
                    turn into humans, but it wasn't happening. In the robot's hand now were two heads because the
                    generals were inside the heads. It combined the heads on top of its own head, and a big explosion
                    occurred. The other generals who saw this incident stopped whatever they were dealing with and
                    started running toward the incident. General Kil was taking down the robots trying to stop them one
                    by one. The robot raised the box into the air, and armored robots started coming out from inside.
                    Signals were coming from everyone's receivers. Everyone knew what this meant. These robots were
                    level 4 robots. General Baz was hitting the robots with his swords, but he couldn't damage them. The
                    robot tensed up, hit the general, and the general flew 30 meters backward. Generals Kala, Tiz and
                    Şont entered among 10 robots and used their powers, but they only tore apart 1 of them. The robots
                    punched the generals, and the generals crashed into each other. They couldn't move. The robots
                    lifted them into the air and threw them all to different places. They had all turned into human
                    form; they were struggling to get up. A few soldiers around took the generals and retreated. When
                    General Kil understood that the arrows weren't piercing the robots' armor, he started shooting at
                    their joints. It was working a bit, but they were still continuing to come out of the box. The
                    armored soldiers immediately surrounded the robots. They were trying to close the top by connecting
                    to each other. The robots had back rockets that made them fast when necessary. They opened their
                    back rockets and went directly toward the closed border and were trying to crack the area. Warriors
                    were entering inside. They were attacking the robots' joints. It was mostly working. They were
                    dropping the robots to the ground and tearing them apart, but sometimes it didn't work. The robots
                    were throwing hard punches at the warriors when they encountered them. The shield had shattered; the
                    soldiers had scattered, and the robots had split in two, but they were still continuing to advance.
                    Then suddenly the ground started shaking. While everyone was trying to understand what was
                    happening, a loud scream came from behind. Everyone looked back, and the dinosaur was spewing fire
                    into the air.</p>

                <h2 class="chapter-title">Water City</h2>

                <p>The tsunami had approached. The silhouettes on it were visible. While General Ops was trying to
                    understand who was coming, they shot red flares on top of the tsunami. Understanding this, General
                    Ops started shouting "Help has arrived" and gave the attack order to the soldiers in the palace.
                    Hearing this, the soldiers started drinking whatever pills they had in their hands and started
                    attacking, but they were all melting, affected by the poison. The acidic robots had reached the
                    palace. In front of the palace, the soldiers were trying to resist, but they were struggling. The
                    remaining 10 robots had also joined the battle. They were trying to protect the palace. But at the
                    same time, they had to try to escape from the acid. That's why they had to slowly move away from the
                    palace. They allowed them to enter the palace, and the shield soldiers formed a wall to prevent them
                    from coming back out.</p>

                <p>One day later, General Tap had arrived at the city. Around, there were a lot of half-melted robots.
                    He hoped he hadn't arrived too late. He had 10m left to reach the palace. He could see the green
                    smoke rising from the building and the crowd in front of the building. He started running, and when
                    they arrived at the building, General Tap turned into human form and greeted everyone.</p>

                <div class="dialogue">
                    <p><span class="speaker">General Tap:</span> "Is it very bad?"</p>

                <div class="dialogue">

                <div class="dialogue">
                    <p><span class="speaker">Soldier:</span> "Only water can stop the acid."</p>
                </div>

                <p>After the soldier said this, he looked at the general. Then an idea came to the general's mind. He
                    told everyone to gather their belongings and go to Miki city. Then he looked at the 2 generals and
                    after seeing them nod yes, he started running in robot form toward the sea.</p>

                <p>Three hours later, General Tap was coming toward the palace with a 50m tsunami behind him. Outside,
                    there were acidic robots. The robots had seen him and started running toward the general, but the
                    general was faster. The general stopped and gave the order for the tsunami to continue. The 50m
                    tsunami was advancing toward the palace, also taking the robots inside and trying to drown the
                    robots. When the waters reached the building, water was gushing from every part of the building. The
                    building had collapsed, and there was nothing moving. After the general was sure, he got on the
                    single-person train and set off to go to his own city.</p>

                <p>Two days later, when he arrived at the bridge, Tiki soldiers were trying to stop the dinosaur. The
                    soldiers hadn't noticed him. He had to join the battle because he would either escape from there
                    with the help of the sea or help them. He chose help. With the waters he sent, he was stopping the
                    fire the robot was spewing at the soldiers. Then something caught his eye in the atmosphere. Two
                    meteors were coming toward them.</p>

                <div class="chapter-number">Chapter 5</div>
                <h2 class="chapter-title">Dinosaur?</h2>

                <p>Two days before, seeing the dinosaur, General Şik gathered his belongings and immediately started
                    running toward the border. Because he could clearly see what would happen. The dinosaur would first
                    destroy the shield, then everywhere. General Plank freed himself from the spear-thrower holding him
                    in the air and immediately cut General Kipso's connection with the ground. The moment he cut the
                    connection, General Kipso turned into human form. Then General Plank also turned into human form and
                    started slapping the general to bring him to himself. Seeing it wasn't working, he put the general
                    on his back and started running toward the sea. The dinosaur had reached the beam. The dinosaur had
                    also crushed the level 3 robot together with the box, and the shield had lifted. Seeing this, tons
                    of Tiki soldiers started running directly inside, but seeing General Lap flying in the air with
                    spear-thrower accompaniment, General Şik running toward them with hands in the air saying to
                    retreat, and the fire-spewing dinosaur at the very back, they immediately started running away. When
                    the soldiers reached halfway on the return road, the dinosaur raised its tail and hit the ground. It
                    sent a shock wave to the surroundings, mostly blue in color but unclear. General Plank with General
                    Kipso on his back saw the shock wave and jumped into the sea, and the shock wave passed over them.
                    Nothing happened to General Lap either, but General Şik wasn't this lucky. The moment the sound wave
                    hit him, the general flew 20m forward and couldn't get back up and couldn't even turn into human
                    form. Also, all the soldiers trying to escape had died. Seeing this, General Lap shouted toward the
                    general, but seeing there was no return, he punched the spear-thrower in the heart and freed himself
                    from the spear-thrower as he fell to the ground. Then he spun his hammer and hit the ground toward
                    the dinosaur, then ran to help. The general was on the robot's head. He ripped the head off its
                    place and started running. While running, he looked back and saw the dinosaur standing on one foot,
                    spewing fire into the air. When he hit the ground with the hammer, the ground with the effect of the
                    blade effect had stuck in its foot. It looked at the general with angry eyes and started going
                    toward the upper forested area.</p>

                <p>One and a half days later, the dinosaur had come to the 3rd region. Everyone was shocked. They had
                    news about the dinosaur, but they didn't know it would come here. Generals Kala, Tiz and Şont were
                    trying to return to their cities. Baz was trying to crawl into the water. The dinosaur started
                    running toward the center. The soldiers were running away; those who couldn't escape were being
                    crushed under the dinosaur. When it approached the level 3 robot, it jumped forward. It crushed the
                    robot, and the dinosaur hit its tail to the ground. The generals had been saved, but there was no
                    trace of the soldiers. Then it sent a laser beam into the air. Then it ran back the way it came.</p>

                <p>Three and a half days later, the dinosaur had crossed to the other side of the bridge. Tiki soldiers
                    were trying to stop the dinosaur. Generals Lap and Şik were trying to stop the dinosaur with their
                    powers. General Şik was shooting at every part of the dinosaur from the very back, but it wasn't
                    working. Then he saw the waters coming to the dinosaur and turned around. He made eye contact with
                    General Tap.</p>

                <div class="separator">⚔</div>

                <p>While all these events were happening, Prince Voz was trying to move the dynasty. The robots were
                    ready and waiting. He had moved 85% of the dynasty. In the middle of the move, sirens had started
                    ringing. The soldiers were turning into robots and going to battle. The prince grabbed one of the
                    soldiers and asked.</p>

                <div class="dialogue">
                    <p><span class="speaker">Prince:</span> "What's happening?"</p>

                    <p><span class="speaker">Soldier:</span> "The dinosaur came."</p>
                </div>

                <p>Hearing this, the prince was shocked. He looked forward, and although he couldn't see the dinosaur,
                    he could see the flames it was spewing upward. He turned to the soldiers and said 'if you finish
                    this move in 5 hours, I'll give you 1 month vacation,' and all the workers in the moving phase
                    started accelerating. He turned back again and saw 2 meteors in the atmosphere.</p>

                <div class="separator">⚔</div>

                <p>One of the meteors had fallen to the other side of the bridge. Generals Tap and Şik had seen this.
                    General Şik looked at the robot that fell behind with the scope on his gun, and he was speechless.
                    The entire surrounding of its body was red. It was burning everywhere it passed, and it was shooting
                    lasers from its mouth toward the peak. It started advancing toward them. The dinosaur in front of
                    them had advanced 20m. A lot of soldiers had died. General Şik blew his whistle in a way everyone
                    would understand. The moment the Tiki soldiers heard it, they started running backward. The dinosaur
                    started burning the soldiers at the very back. General Lap started advancing to the right side to
                    distract the dinosaur. When he thought he had gone far enough to the right, he turned to the
                    dinosaur and tried to upset the dinosaur's balance by hitting his hammer on the ground. The
                    dinosaur's attention was distracted. It turned to the general and started walking toward him. It was
                    trying to burn the general with flame shots, but it wasn't working. Finally, the dinosaur raised its
                    tail and just as it was about to lower it, its foot slipped. Not understanding what happened, the
                    general saw the tsunami behind the dinosaur. Its feet were in the water. General Tap was burning in
                    blue on top of the tsunami. There were also soldiers next to him. The dinosaur turned back and
                    started spewing flames, but it wasn't working. General Tal raised his hands and took the dinosaur
                    inside a water balloon. The dinosaur was trying to use its tail, but it wasn't working. It opened
                    its mouth and started shooting lasers upward, but the moment it did this, water started filling its
                    mouth. What the dinosaur was doing wasn't working; it was about to die. But then General Şik saw the
                    blue beam coming toward the balloon. The soldiers and General Tap who saw the beam tried to get in
                    front of the beam. The soldiers built a wall from shields in front, and General Tap created a water
                    barrier behind the soldiers. The beam had passed the soldiers but got stuck in the water barrier.
                    General Şik was watching these events when he saw the shock wave coming from behind. He thought 'the
                    barrier can't withstand this.' What he thought happened. When the shock wave hit the water, the
                    barrier exploded, and General Tap flew backward. The beam passed through the balloon and exploded
                    the balloon. The dinosaur inside fell to the ground and stood up. The other dinosaur also came to
                    its side, and now there were 2, and they started walking.</p>

                <div class="separator">⚔</div>

                <p>The other one had fallen somewhere in Tiki dynasty's lands. The scouts wandering around in Miki
                    dominion could see the dust cloud. The dinosaur had stood up. Its appearance was about 40m. It had
                    wings and was spiky. The dinosaur turned around and made eye contact with the scout looking at it
                    with binoculars. The scout trembled with fear and raised his head from the binoculars and looked at
                    his friend next to him, but when he looked back at where the dinosaur was, the dinosaur had gone. He
                    looked again and again, but there was nothing. The sirens weren't ringing either. This meant the
                    dinosaur was going toward the area trying to move the dynasty. The scout made eye contact with his
                    friend and said 'we must go to the palace immediately and tell what happened,' and the two entered
                    the palace together.</p>

                <div class="separator">⚔</div>

                <p>They had arrived at the palace. No one around the palace knew anything, and when they entered inside,
                    they shouted loudly:</p>

                <p>While they were arguing about whether to go help or not, the 2 girls and 2 boys from Tal city, Prince
                    Baw, the prince's siblings and a few soldiers were looking at each other. While the prince was
                    approaching the queen, he gave a signal. Understanding this, the soldiers took action. The eldest
                    prince Puk from Tal city stood directly in front of the queen, and the other soldiers moving to
                    create a rebellion went behind the soldiers inside to kill the soldiers inside. The prince
                    approached the queen and helped her stand up. The signal had been received. Prince Puk raised the
                    gun he was hiding and shot the queen. Everyone who heard the sound was in shock. While looking at
                    each other to understand who was shot, the queen collapsed on the ground, and the soldiers in the
                    rebellion killed the other soldiers. The inside had turned into a complete pool of blood. Seeing
                    this incident, General Matrak turned into an eagle and flew away. Prince Baw had seen this but
                    didn't do anything and turned to the crowd.</p>

                        advanced ships and we'll be able to attack everywhere easily."</p>

                        Soldiers, go to Til and Mik cities, and friends, go to take those places by leaving soldiers.
                        Then we'll make ships, tanks, robots and whatever makes us stronger than other cities. By the
                        way, send 10 battalion soldiers and robots after General Matrak. He can't pass all that way
                        without a break. Follow him to where he goes and start a war there. Also, from now on, all
                        soldiers will be close combat warriors. There will be few archers; the remaining archers will be
                        trained for close combat. Dragons will be punishment for the prisoners in the dungeons, and the
                        parts in the tanks will be attached to the robots. Now you can go to take the areas remaining
                        from the dinosaur in the Tiki region."</p>
                </div>

                <p>Two hours later, 10 battalion soldiers (200,000 soldiers) and 10 robots had set off to follow General
                    Matrak. The remaining soldiers were being trained in the hangar. The mechanics were dismantling the
                    tanks and attaching them to the remaining robots. All the workers were working hard. Prince Puk and
                    5 thousand soldiers had started descending to Tiki dynasty. While the soldiers were advancing, they
                    were passing through the places the dinosaur had burned. They were also taking care to go hiding.
                    Puk was saying to himself, "I hope we see such things below too."</p>

                <div class="separator">⚔</div>

                <p>While all this chaos was happening, Prince Voz was trying to move the dynasty. The robots were ready
                    and waiting. He had completed 85% of the move. At the same time, they had to deal with 2 dinosaurs.
                    Tiki soldiers continued shooting at the dinosaurs, but it wasn't working. The prince was uneasy. He
                    was losing his soldiers and couldn't do anything. Every time he looked at the convoy being moved.
                    When he made eye contact with the soldier directing the move, the soldier signaled with his hands
                    that 10 minutes remained. Although time was short, the prince was still anxious; he had suspicions
                    that something would happen. Then suddenly the ground started shaking. When the prince looked
                    around, he saw the dinosaur coming from afar, scattering electricity around and burning everything
                    around it. He looked at the door and made eye contact with the soldier. The move still hadn't
                    finished, but the prince called out to the soldiers.</p>

                <div class="dialogue">
                    <p><span class="speaker">Prince:</span> "Soldiers, protection position; the rest immediately enter
                        inside."</p>
                </div>

                <p>After the soldiers heard this, after leaving 20 thousand soldiers outside, everyone entered the
                    palace. The soldiers remaining outside started moving away from the palace to protect those inside.
                    The 3rd dinosaur had also come. The soldiers at the very back were trying to reach the seashore, but
                    those at the very front weren't very lucky. The dinosaurs were giving electricity, spewing fire and
                    shooting laser beams at the soldiers in front. The soldiers at the very back started running toward
                    the sea. Seeing this, the dinosaurs started chasing them from behind by spewing fire.</p>

                <p>Half an hour later, all the soldiers had died. The dinosaurs at the seashore then looked behind them
                    once and jumped into the water and disappeared from view. Everyone at the palace had watched all
                    these events live. Just as the prince was about to turn around and tell the crowd they had left, a
                    movement caught his eye. A group of soldiers was coming from above, but the strange thing was that
                    the vests they were wearing weren't the clothes Mik soldiers wore. Something had happened on the
                    upper side. He turned to the soldiers and asked them to prepare for attack. Then the man at the very
                    front caught his eye. He saw Prince Puk. A light bulb went on above his head. Something had happened
                    in Miki city, and this wasn't a good sign at all. He had to learn what happened immediately. He
                    turned to the crowd inside and gave the attack order. The soldiers started attacking with cheers at
                    the soldiers passing in front of the door. They had surrounded them. Prince Voz had also come
                    outside. He told his soldiers to kill everyone except Prince Puk, then bring the prince inside to
                    the interrogation room.</p>

                <p>Two hours later, Prince Puk's face was covered in blood, and he still hadn't said a single word. Only
                    one question was being asked of him. That question was 'What happened in Miki city?' But he wasn't
                    answering in any way. The only thing he said was 'Romulus warriors don't betray.' The prince was
                    tired of hearing these, so he left 2 soldiers in the room and went to the royal room to discuss this
                    topic.</p>

                <p>Two days had passed, but no one had returned to Romulus Empire. Prince Baw was starting to get
                    anxious. The empire was growing more and more, and the soldiers were turning into monsters. It was
                    slowly spreading to Tiki city. At this time, the ships, planes and robots in the empire were being
                    developed. It was advancing on the path of an unstoppable force. He wanted to become king. All he
                    had to do was get married, and his eyes saw only one person. It was the sister of Prince Tilk, but
                    she always ran away from Baw. He told this to the prince, and Prince Tilk told Prince Baw 'If you go
                    until you see the first soldier on the other continent, I'll allow this.' No matter how angry Baw
                    got, Prince Tilk was right. To be able to marry, he had to show his power. He turned to the soldier
                    next to him and said 'go to the headquarters and tell the soldiers to only sleep 4 hours and
                    strengthen themselves otherwise, and he added 'This is an order.' The soldier ran away. When the two
                    princes shook hands, Princess Şekin was secretly watching them. After the princes separated, she
                    moved away from there.</p>

                <h2 class="chapter-title">This is Just the Beginning</h2>

                <p>While General Matrak was going to Sem city, after stopping at the last island in the stations on the
                    way, he set off again. While flying in the air, he saw something sparkling in the water. He got a
                    bit closer to the sparkling thing and saw that this sparkling thing was General Tap. He climbed back
                    up and dived directly into the water. When he dove into the water, he turned into a whale and
                    swallowed General Tap and started swimming toward Sem city.</p>

                <p>Three hours later, when General Matrak reached the shore, he spat General Tap toward the shore, and
                    the moment he turned into human form, he collapsed on the ground. A few hours later, when he opened
                    his eyes, he saw General Tap above him. He got up and asked:</p>

                <div class="dialogue">
                    <p><span class="speaker">Matrak:</span> "What happened?"</p>

                        the beam sent by the other dinosaur coming from behind exploded the balloon, so I flew backward
                        and came here semi-conscious. By the way, there was one more meteor, but I don't know what
                        happened to it. Anyway, what happened to you?"</p>
                </div>

                <div class="dialogue">
                    <p><span class="speaker">Matrak:</span> "Prince Baw started a rebellion, so I escaped. Then I don't

                </div>

                <p>While the two generals were discussing what happened, they heard sounds coming from afar. When they
                    turned their heads toward the incoming sound, they saw 10 planes (200,000 soldiers) filled to the
                    brim and 5 robots coming from the sea coming toward them. The logos on the planes were different. RS
                    was written on them. The robots looked very different from the ones they produced. They looked
                    faster, bigger, more armored, but they couldn't wait to understand this. General Matrak immediately
                    turned into an eagle, grabbed General Tap by the arms and immediately started flying toward the
                    palace.</p>

                <div class="separator">⚔</div>

                <p>10 minutes later, they had crashed through the window into the room where the king was. Everyone in
                    the room had pointed their weapons at them in fear. General Tap was immediately shouting "stop,
                    stop." While the people inside were trying to understand what was happening, General Matrak also
                    turned into human form. A voice came from behind: "General, is it you?" When everyone looked where
                    the voice came from, the king was approaching the generals.</p>

                <div class="dialogue">
                    <p><span class="speaker">King:</span> "I thought something happened to you. What happened?"</p>

                    <p><span class="speaker">Matrak:</span> "Your Excellency, I don't want to interrupt your reunion,
                        but right now there are soldiers coming to attack. When Prince Baw started a rebellion in Miki
                        city, I escaped, and they must have followed me. You must take action immediately."</p>
                </div>

                <p>After the king heard these words, he wiped his tears and shouted 'To battle.'</p>

                <p>When the Romulus warriors landed on shore, the sirens were ringing.</p>

                <div class="separator">⚔</div>

                <p>The Sem soldiers were ready for battle. All the soldiers were turning into robots one by one and with
                    the robots behind them, they started advancing toward the battle on the shore. The warriors had no
                    fear. The officer at their head signaled for the robots to launch the rockets. As the rockets
                    exploded on the robots, each one was falling one by one. Seeing this, General Matrak turned hundreds
                    of soldiers into eagles and went on the attack. The eagles were very fast; it was almost impossible
                    to follow them. The remaining soldiers were running. General Tap raised the water behind them and
                    brought it down on them as a tsunami. The warriors' reflexes were very fast. They immediately jumped
                    to the side and except for 2 robots next to them, without being affected by the tsunami, with
                    cheers, ignoring the eagles above them, they started running toward the soldiers coming from the
                    opposite side. The Sem soldiers were slowly starting to fall back. They had just come out of battle,
                    and the soldiers were tired. Also, the warriors' numbers were high and they were fast. Seeing this,
                    General Matrak turned the soldiers next to him into dragons and gave the attack order. When the
                    dragons joined the battle, the soldiers gained confidence and went on the attack with the incoming
                    energy. The place had turned into a hellish place. Unless the warriors took heavy blows from swords
                    and arrows, they were only dying from the dragons' fire. Arrows and rockets were flying in the air.
                    The rockets that came across dragons were killing them. The warriors were slowly advancing. When the
                    king saw the battlefield, he understood he would use the power to turn into a robot and made eye
                    contact with General Tap. General Tap understood what he had to do. When the time came, he would
                    sweep the water behind them into the battlefield. The king turned into a robot and turned the
                    soldiers next to them into robot rhinos and started running.</p>

                <div class="separator">⚔</div>

                <p>Ten days before, General Baz had hit the shore in a place no one could see. He opened his eyes and
                    stood up. After taking 2 steps, he collapsed on the ground again. A few hours later, 2 men standing
                    next to him were trying to wake him up. These were 2 warriors next to the Romulus general, but Baz
                    didn't know this. With a sudden movement, he laid the 2 people on top of him on the ground and
                    asked.</p>

                <div class="dialogue">
                    <p><span class="speaker">General Baz:</span> "Where am I? There was a dinosaur, battle... what
                        happened?"</p>

                <div class="dialogue">

                </div>

                <p>After General Baz heard these, he pulled his hands from their throats and stood up. Both soldiers
                    simultaneously kicked him in the head, and he collapsed on the ground again. These kicks made him
                    forget what he needed to remember, but he knew he was a soldier. A few hours later, when he came to
                    himself, the 2 soldiers were still sitting next to him, having made a fire. Seeing the general come
                    to himself, they gave him the drinks and food they used in their own army. The general asked the two
                    soldiers next to him:</p>

                <div class="dialogue">
                    <p><span class="speaker">General:</span> "Is the battle still continuing?"</p>
                </div>

                <p>They also nodded their heads in an affirmative way. The general tried to stand up but couldn't.</p>

                <p>A few hours later, they started the exercises. Baz kept falling to the ground, but he continued
                    getting up. Although Baz was falling to the ground and despite his wounds, he felt vigorous, but
                    holding out against 2 people was difficult for him. Despite being beaten up, he wasn't giving up
                    fighting. They were doing this morning and evening without sleeping. 3 days had passed, and he had
                    brought down 1 soldier to the ground, but the other soldier had laid him on the ground. The soldiers
                    looked at each other and gave a look indicating things were going well. Between the battles, since
                    Baz took the food and drinks offered to him, he felt more and more savage. Fire was spurting from
                    his eyes. Every time he had more energy. Seeing this, the soldiers became much happier. 8 days had
                    passed, and they still hadn't slept. After Baz brought down one soldier to the ground, he was very
                    close to laying down the other one too, but the soldier laid him on the ground. On the 10th day, he
                    had finally succeeded in laying down both of them. Baz couldn't stay in place anymore. He was like a
                    bomb ready to explode. When the soldiers saw him in this state, they started getting excited because
                    he was ready now. At the end of the day, they set off... When the time came, one word was needed for
                    him to run to battle. That word was 'Go Attack.'</p>

                <p>Four days later, the king with 500 soldiers turned into rhinos was advancing toward the center by
                    throwing horns at the soldiers in front of him. After crushing a few warriors, they slowed down a
                    bit because of the shields they formed. While the Romulus general was focused on the rhinos, he
                    noticed the water behind him was rising. Seeing this, the Romulus general gave the "Attack" order to
                    his soldiers. Although their numbers were few, they were resisting well. The dragons above were
                    waiting for their defenseless moment. General Matrak was sitting on top of a dragon. When he raised
                    his head to look at the battlefield, he saw 3 people walking. When he looked with the binoculars
                    next to him, he was shocked. Because it was General Baz next to 2 soldiers not from theirs. He was
                    joking with them. He couldn't stay in place, and his eyes... his eyes were spewing fire. He
                    immediately took the trumpet next to him and blew it. Hearing this, all the soldiers went on the
                    attack, and the Romulus general shot the purple flare into the air with a hope. The soldiers coming
                    from afar and General Baz had also seen this. The soldiers shot the purple flare in their hands into
                    the air, turned to the general and said 'Go Attack.' General Baz turned into a robot and started
                    running toward the battlefield. His robot form was in flames, and his eyes were also yellow.</p>

                <div class="chapter-number">Chapter 8</div>
                <h2 class="chapter-title">Port?</h2>

                <p>Generals Şik and semi-conscious Kipso had somehow made it out to the port. General Kipso had finally
                    come to himself. After vomiting the water they swallowed, they looked around. They were standing at
                    the port, but the port was much higher than it should be, and there was a wall built for walking,
                    advancing toward the middle of the island. They started advancing on the wall. While walking on the
                    wall, they started looking around. It seemed there was nothing around, but when they looked down,
                    they saw there were a lot of creatures. They were trying to climb up, but they couldn't. After
                    walking until evening, 4 creatures appeared in front of them. After turning into robots and handling
                    the creatures, after advancing a bit more, they slept.</p>

                <p>When morning came, since they understood they couldn't go back, they continued advancing on the wall.
                    There were a lot of creatures around the wall. After passing the middle of the wall, they understood
                    the wall was sloping downward. While walking, they put their hands in their pockets, and both of
                    them had a lot of different colored pills in their pockets. This meant when they found some people,
                    they could give them the pills and cooperate. While continuing to walk, they were hearing gunshot
                    sounds from ahead. When they looked at the edge of the wall forward, there were soldiers shooting at
                    the creatures. General Şik immediately turned into a robot. With the machine gun in his hand, he
                    started shooting and running toward the creatures. General Kipso, in human form, started running
                    toward the soldiers' side.</p>

                <p>While the soldiers were shooting at the creatures, they felt the ground shaking. The creatures
                    weren't doing this. When the 10 soldiers turned around, they had seen the robot coming shooting at
                    the creatures. While they couldn't think about what to do, there was someone running behind the
                    robot. When the coming person approached them, they saw he was wearing a general's uniform. They
                    lowered the weapons they turned toward him and started waiting. When General Kipso reached their
                    side, he gave the pills in his hand to the soldiers and said "The last to remain dies; your time is
                    limited," and touched one soldier's shoulder. The soldier whose shoulder was touched ran to the side
                    and after swallowing the pill, jumped down. Not understanding what was happening, the other nine
                    soldiers pointed their weapons at the general, but when a blue light appeared from behind them, they
                    turned and went to the side. They were shocked by what they saw because the soldier who drank the
                    pill had turned into a warrior robot and was fighting. They turned to the general, and the general
                    said to them 'Come on, join them.' The soldiers immediately drank the pills and jumped down. Four of
                    them turned into durable robots, 3 turned into warrior robots, and 2 turned into rocket-launching
                    robots. Two of the tank soldiers started running; the other one stayed behind to protect his friend.
                    The running soldiers were advancing by crashing into the creatures. Those they crashed into couldn't
                    get up again. When they caught up with their fighting comrades, they immediately went in front of
                    them and took them under protection from creature attacks. Now the creatures couldn't touch them.
                    While they were fighting on the right side of the wall with General Şik, General Kipso had joined
                    the 5 soldiers fighting on the left side of the wall.</p>

                <p>Two days later, the island had been completely cleaned of creatures. While the generals were
                    fighting, they had noticed the shelters on the island. While the soldiers were fighting, they
                    entered the shelters, and there were 50 thousand soldiers hiding in each shelter. After including
                    them in their battles, the battle with creatures ended in a shorter time. After cleaning the island
                    and cutting the trees in the forest to make ships, after combining them with iron from the mines,
                    they would make enough submarines for all the soldiers here. The generals and a few soldiers started
                    looking out from the port into the distance.</p>

                <div class="dialogue">
                    <p><span class="speaker">General Şik:</span> "What's our situation? We cut all the forest and with

                        setting off in 10 days.' Take this badge with my writing on it and show it when the time comes."

                </div>

                <p>After Elliot heard the order, while he was leaving their side immediately, he heard that the generals
                    could reach the other side in 5 days and set off to go to the other side of the island.</p>

                <div class="separator">⚔</div>

                <p>Elliot reached the other side of the island 3 days later. When he arrived, it had gotten dark. After
                    camping that night, he set off right away in the morning. He had 5 days' worth of food, but
                    depending on the wind and sea, this number could change. After his friends pushed the boat, he set
                    off.</p>

                <p>Seven days later, Elliot had 20m left to reach the nearest city, but his boat was wrecked. Holes had
                    formed due to the waves, and he was very tired. When 10m remained, the boat sank, and he started
                    swimming with his remaining strength. He could barely see ahead. When he reached shore, he barely
                    stood up, and a few people were pointing guns at him. He couldn't get a single word out of his
                    mouth. He took a step forward and collapsed on the ground.</p>

                <p>Two days later, when Elliot opened his eyes, he had come to himself. When he looked around, he was in
                    a room with only a place to lie down, and sounds were coming from outside. The first to enter was a
                    nurse. When the nurse saw him awake, she gestured outside, and a general entered.</p>

                        Stop whichever 2 generals are there. Also, you might see your own soldiers there because most
                        likely they sent 1 soldier to either Bati or Kem city to inform them what to do. In fact, you
                        might encounter generals from your own city. General Kala will go to help Sem city. Generals Lap
                        and Baz will go with all the soldiers to close the portal to the island. My ordered soldiers

                <p>Baz had joined the battle. He was fighting together with Romulus warriors. The soldiers were having
                    difficulty standing in front of him. He had dived directly into the middle of the battle. Seeing
                    Baz, the king retreated with 100 soldiers, but the rest were stuck in between and died. The king
                    went to General Tap's side and told him to upset their balance, and the general started moving the
                    water. He could also control the animals in the water. The animals in the water started upsetting
                    the warriors' balance, and they all lost their balance and fell into the water. General Matrak had
                    also come down. General Kil was shooting, but the bullets weren't working much. The only thing they
                    were affected by was fire.</p>

                </div>

                <p>General Matrak directed the dragons above down, and they started burning the warriors. The warriors
                    were slowly dying, but their numbers were still very high. If help didn't come soon, they would all
                    die, and they were shooting down the help coming from the air.</p>

                <div class="dialogue">
                    <p><span class="speaker">King:</span> "Use the train."</p>

                        through the inside of the palace."</p>
                </div>

                <p>When the king finished his sentence, the warrior robots had destroyed the palace. They couldn't
                    escape inside. Now the only way was to fight. When they all looked forward, they saw Baz coming. He
                    was coming by tearing apart the soldiers in front of him and was burning in flames. This way, he
                    looked even more frightening.</p>

                <div class="dialogue">
                    <p><span class="speaker">King:</span> "Soldiers, deal with those around; generals, you stay behind
                        me and help to defeat Baz."</p>
                </div>

                <p>Hearing this, the soldiers started running to the battlefield with cheers. The generals started
                    running toward Baz. General Kip had stayed at the back; he was shooting at the warriors to slow them
                    down. While shooting at the warriors, he saw someone being thrown into the air. When he looked in
                    that direction, he saw the King and Tap fighting with Baz. When he looked up again, he saw General
                    Matrak turning into an eagle and going down quickly. Seeing this, General Kip saw that the king and
                    General Tap were holding Baz and General Matrak turned into a kangaroo near the fight and hit hard
                    with his foot. Baz flew 20m backward, but got up again and started running toward them. When Baz
                    reached the group's side, he hit two of them hard. Both were going into the air. Baz also jumped
                    into the air, hit both of them together, and the robots shattered. When he looked down, the King was
                    left alone. He looked around; his eldest son (25 years old) was standing 5m behind him. He couldn't
                    kill him either; he went to his side and gave him half his weapons.</p>

                <div class="dialogue">
                    <p><span class="speaker">Kil:</span> "Prince Şim, Prince Şim. You mustn't get injured. Take these
                        weapons and shoot at the creature. The King mustn't die. No matter what, protect us and your
                        sister. Do you understand?"</p>
                </div>

                <div class="dialogue">
                    <p><span class="speaker">Prince Şim:</span> "What are you talking about?"</p>
                </div>

                <div class="dialogue">
                    <p><span class="speaker">Kil:</span> "Your father is left alone there. I must help him. If someone
                        not from us comes near us, protect us."</p>
                </div>

                <div class="dialogue">
                    <p><span class="speaker">Şim:</span> "Okay, okay, you go."</p>
                </div>

                <p>Kil started running toward the king's side. Baz had landed next to the king. The king started going
                    backward. He was trying to dodge the punches, but it was very difficult. His foot got caught on a
                    stone, and he fell to the ground. He didn't have time to get up, so he started crawling backward,
                    but his eyes were still on Baz. He could hear sounds coming from afar. Someone was coming from
                    behind him. That's why he did a backflip and stood up, but he couldn't maintain his balance. Baz
                    took advantage of this opportunity and went on the attack. The king raised his hands and took his
                    face under protection, but before the punch came, someone pushed him aside. The king had rolled 5
                    meters to the side. Baz's punches had hit General Kil. With the effect of the punches, the general
                    slid 70m backward on the ground. When he hit the shattered walls of the palace, his eyes closed.
                    When the king opened his eyes again, he looked around. His soldiers were slowly advancing forward,
                    but General Kil had also been neutralized. Now the person defending was himself. When he looked a
                    bit to the right of General Kil, he saw his son and daughter. When he made eye contact with them, he
                    felt the fear in their eyes, and he got up again. He felt a power inside him waiting to come out had
                    awakened. He turned back into a robot, but this time flames were coming out of the robot. The anger
                    inside him was coming out. Baz saw this, turned toward the King, and started running. The king had
                    also started running. They both knew that unless one of them ended with death, this war wouldn't
                    end. While they were fighting, the soldiers were pushing the warriors toward the sea.</p>

                <p>Two days had passed, but the war hadn't ended yet. The king and Baz were still fighting. One of
                    General Baz's arms had broken off, but he was still fighting. Every time they got injured, they
                    turned back into robots and continued fighting. It was the 20th day of the war. Both sides had lost
                    a lot of soldiers. The soldiers had advanced a bit more. The Romulus warriors were dying, albeit
                    slowly. Seeing this, the Romulus general used the bomb the prince gave with 5 soldiers and
                    teleported back.</p>

                <p>Generals Matrak and Tap were trying to get up. 50m to their left was General Kil. His injuries were
                    very bad. When Baz shattered the robots, he had forgotten to crush their heads. This way, they had
                    survived. General Tap managed to raise his head. What he saw was horrifying. The king and Baz were
                    in what seemed like an endless battle, and cracks had formed around them. On the seashore, the
                    soldiers were still fighting. Their numbers seemed more than the warriors. When he looked a bit
                    above the battle, he saw a lot of planes coming toward where they were. When he tried to look more
                    carefully, blue smoke was rising from the planes. This meant help had arrived.</p>

                <p>50m remained to shore. General Kipso told via radio not to join the war with launch ramps unless he
                    gave news. His submarine was the first to surface. When they surfaced, they saw two soldiers waiting
                    on shore. When they looked more carefully with binoculars, they saw there was an army behind them.
                    They had sensed that they were coming. So this was a bad sign. Their technology was advanced. When
                    the submarine came ashore, General Kipso came out, and he and General Şik started walking toward the
                    2 people standing in front. When they reached their side, the soldiers in the submarine started
                    coming out.</p>

                <p>The Dotso soldiers were shouting. One of the generals was giving them a speech. Seeing this, General
                    Şik asked the submarines underwater to surface and also prepare the missiles. General Kipso ordered
                    via radio for the soldiers who came with them to come to their side immediately. The Dotso soldiers
                    had started walking toward them. When 30m remained, the Dotso soldiers stopped, and the 4 generals
                    met again. General Kipso's own soldiers were also 20m behind them.</p>

                <p>Without moving from his place, General Twes gave the order for the soldiers to attack with his hand.
                    The Dotso soldiers had started running. Seeing this, General Şik immediately turned to his radio and
                    ordered all the missiles in 5 submarines to be fired, and after firing, all soldiers to come ashore
                    immediately to help. General Kipso ordered the soldiers on shore to keep the pills ready. The
                    general brothers were confused. While they were trying to understand what they said, a lot of
                    missiles from above them were going toward the soldiers behind them. The missiles had fallen on
                    hundreds of soldiers in front. Hundreds of soldiers had died. The place was dusty and smoky. No one
                    could see ahead. General Kipso called out via radio, "Now," and the soldiers on shore, as far as the
                    general brothers understood, jumped somewhere. Mechanical sounds were coming from the back. When
                    they looked back, they saw a lot of robots killing their own soldiers. While watching what was
                    happening, they saw barrels passing over them one by one. When the barrels fell to the ground,
                    Generals Kipso and Şik moved toward the seashore. The twin generals didn't understand why they went
                    back, but taking this as an opportunity, they also started slowly going toward where their soldiers
                    were.</p>

                <p>Two hours later, thousands of Dotso soldiers had died. They couldn't resist the robots. The twin
                    generals were arguing inside their tents in the battlefield.</p>

                </div>

                <p>After everyone said okay, they dispersed. The war continued. A lot of soldiers from the terrorists
                    had also died. Generals Kipso and Şik had approached to see the battlefield with 50 thousand
                    soldiers. 20 thousand soldiers were waiting by the sea, and the remaining soldiers were fighting.
                    The last soldiers in front of the forest had also died. Both sides had seen this. General Kipso shot
                    a green signal flare for the soldiers to advance and turned to those next to him to talk. While they
                    were talking, they heard a whistle sound.</p>

                </div>

                <p>While everyone was trying to understand where the sound was coming from, light started appearing from
                    inside the forest. Sounds of soldiers screaming in pain were heard from inside the trees. Something
                    was happening inside the forest. The trees were slowly starting to burn. Something was coming. The
                    place was covered in dust, smoke, and flames. No one could see anything. Then 2 pairs of orange eyes
                    appeared from inside the smoke, and then a 30-meter robot appeared. When it started screaming, fire
                    came out of its mouth, and it had diamond swords in its hands. Two huge robots started advancing.
                    Seeing this, General Şik shot a blue flare for all soldiers to retreat despite all of Kipso's
                    stopping efforts. The soldiers started retreating, but the last soldiers were being crushed under
                    the robots. The giant robots created an earthquake feeling with every step. Everyone was focused on
                    the deaths of the soldiers below when something hit the robots' chests from the air. No one expected
                    this. The robot in front staggered slightly backward. After the smoke cleared from the robot, they
                    saw it was a robot trying to pierce the robot's armor. More robots were coming. The generals trying
                    to understand what was happening looked backward and saw a lot of planes. Someone had arrived.
                    Seeing those arriving, General Şik fired a turquoise signal flare.</p>

                <p>Generals Lap and Tan were heading toward the war. While going, they were also discussing the plan on

                        surrounding stones. We'll start repelling the incoming soldiers with the soldiers we have. By
                        the way, some of the soldiers we have will wait a bit behind us. Also, if necessary, we got
                        orders to enter the city."</p>

                <p>After the generals advanced 5-10 km more, they started seeing Romulus warriors. When they saw the
                    Romulus general, they were surprised because the last time they heard, they were fighting in Sem
                    city. This means they either won or lost the war. But either way, coming here this fast was
                    surprising. The generals of both groups met in the middle.</p>

                <p>After Sezar said his last words, he left from there. He had achieved his goal. He had angered at
                    least one of them. He could hear the shouting sounds from behind. He went to his army's side with a
                    grin. Generals Lap and Tan were arguing while advancing to their own soldiers' side.</p>

                <p>When they saw General Lap whose eyes were shooting fire from anger, they immediately prepared to
                    listen to the orders coming from him.</p>

                <div class="dialogue">

                <p>After hearing this, 15 people stepped forward and immediately went to General Lap's side. The general
                    turned to those soldiers:</p>

                        draw them where we want. Blue flare is for the hidden soldiers to go on the attack. Green flare

                <div class="dialogue">
                    <p><span class="speaker">Tan:</span> "No, forget the green flare, forget it."</p>

                <div class="dialogue">
                    <p><span class="speaker">Lap:</span> "Green flare is for these 15 soldiers. Now we can set off."</p>
                </div>

                <p>General Tan had a lot of questions in his mind. He couldn't ask his questions because Lap left
                    immediately, but his eyes would be on Lap. While everyone was separating, he saw 10 soldiers talking
                    to each other. He went to their side and told them when they saw the black flare, to follow him and
                    if necessary, go help General Lap. After saying this, everyone dispersed.</p>

                <p>The war had started. Tiki soldiers had more numbers, but for every 1 Romulus soldier, there were 3
                    soldiers. Since Romulus soldiers were taller than normal, the soldiers were fighting in robot form.
                    The 15 soldiers General Tan wanted were fighting in the back lines a bit more. Every time General
                    Tan killed a warrior, he looked around, but he couldn't see General Sezar. This meant Sezar was
                    either not fighting or fighting on another side. Since he couldn't see Sezar, he thought he needed
                    to go deeper inside. Next to General Tan, there were 5 tank soldiers, and behind him, there were 20
                    warrior soldiers. He ordered them to run forward. When the soldiers started advancing, Tan, not
                    understanding what was happening, stayed behind and continued fighting. His eyes were still on
                    General Lap. General Lap had an officer next to him. While fighting, he turned to him and said,
                    "When necessary, I'll give you the command."</p>

                <p>The war was still continuing. Sezar was still hiding. He was looking for General Lap's opening. At
                    the same time, he was also killing soldiers. He noticed a plane coming from behind. When the plane
                    landed, he got on the plane with 7 soldiers next to him and started looking at the battlefield from
                    above. There was complete chaos in the battlefield. When he looked at where General Lap was, he saw
                    he was advancing toward the center. He took a bow and arrow from one of the soldiers next to him. He
                    aimed at Lap's side and shot. The moment Lap killed the warrior he was fighting, an arrow passed by
                    his head. When he looked in the direction the arrow came from, he saw Sezar waving at him. The
                    moment he saw this, he started emitting a red light. With this anger, after also killing 10 warriors
                    around him, he shot the green flare into the air. Then he started running in the direction the plane
                    was going. The 15 soldiers under his command were also coming with him from behind. Tan had also
                    seen this with everyone. He was the only one who didn't understand the meaning of this. General Tan
                    immediately turned to the officer next to him and said, "The command is yours; you know what to do,"
                    and then shot the black flare into the air and started running with 10 soldiers under his command to
                    catch up with General Lap. The officer who didn't understand what to do immediately shot the pink
                    flare into the air. The soldiers who couldn't understand what happened in the first two flares
                    immediately started retreating when they saw the pink flare. The soldiers were retreating quickly.
                    The warriors were dumbfounded. While they were standing there not knowing what to do, they heard a
                    sound from above. When they looked up, Sezar was shouting "Attack" to them. They also got excited
                    and started chasing the soldiers.</p>

                <div class="separator">⚔</div>

                <p>When Sezar's plane dropped him on the ground, Lap had also arrived at the same time.</p>

                    think much about it. General Tan, on the other hand, got very tense when he saw it because this
                    meant he would fight to the last drop of his power.)</p>

                <p>When General Tan was about to get up to run, a soldier stopped him and shook his head as if to say it
                    wasn't time. When Tan turned his head, Sezar and Lap had started fighting. The soldiers and warriors
                    were fighting among themselves. He was afraid to watch, but he also had to watch what was happening.
                    He couldn't let General Lap die.</p>

                <p>Five hours later, Sezar and Lap were still fighting. 2 warriors and 4 soldiers had died; the rest
                    continued fighting. When General Tan was about to get up from where he was hiding, one of the
                    soldiers quietly called out to him and pointed somewhere with his finger. Someone in a brown cape
                    was coming toward them. This meant someone came from the center and brought news.</p>

                <p>When General Tan was about to turn his head, Sezar threw Lap toward the rock where they were hiding.
                    Tan couldn't get up. Because of the sun, how many people there were could be understood from the
                    shadows. There were 4 people. While General Tan was thinking about what to do, he saw a shadow rise
                    into the air. He understood that Sezar had lifted him. So Sezar was in the middle; there were 2
                    people on his right, 1 on his left. The general turned to his soldiers and made a bow and arrow
                    sign. 6 soldiers were waiting with arrows in their hands. The general counted to 3 with his hands,
                    and they got up and shot the arrows. The warriors who couldn't understand what was happening had
                    died, and only Sezar remained. Sezar had dropped Lap from that momentary fear and stayed where he
                    was. When the soldiers surrounded Sezar, Tan and 1 soldier were at General Lap's side. Lap was lying
                    semi-conscious, but his consciousness was clear.</p>

                <h2 class="chapter-title">What Happened to These Places?</h2>

                <p>Generals Lap and Tan had arrived at Mostar Island. Even when they arrived at the port, fear seized
                    them. Because everywhere was in ruins. It was clear that there had been a fight here before them.
                    The creatures that should have been on the island weren't there either. The robots that came out of
                    the portal wanting to invade the planet had probably killed them too. When they advanced 10 km more,
                    they could now see the shattered state of one dinosaur robot and the burned and shattered state of
                    other invader robots. Every 5m, they could see the depression in the ground caused by shock waves
                    created by dinosaur robots' tails.</p>

                <p>After leaving 3-5 thousand people in the protected area they encountered on the island and telling
                    them that the retreat flare was turquoise, they continued advancing. As the soldiers advanced, their
                    morale was more broken by the scenes they saw. The more they advanced, the more dead robot parts and
                    holes in the ground they saw. The dinosaur robots had advanced this far, which was amazing.</p>

                <p>They had completed 75% of the road they should have reached the gate passage when they heard a sound.
                    The sound was like ringing. Generals Lap and Tan looked at each other. This meant they were noticed.
                    Just as General Lap was writing the note on the paper in his hand to send news to those behind, an
                    explosion sound came from ahead. Generals Lap and Tan looked at each other again. The soldiers were
                    dumbfounded from exhaustion, but the generals thought something might have happened to the scouts
                    they sent to understand what was ahead. After General Lap took 3 steps, an arrow fell 2 steps in
                    front of him, and there was a paper on the arrow. He pulled the paper from the arrow and started
                    reading silently. When he finished reading, his facial expression was disaster. He raised his head
                    and read what was on the paper out loud.</p>

                <div class="dialogue">
                    <p><span class="speaker">General Lap:</span> "Don't come, run."</p>
                </div>

                <p>He had just finished his sentence when the ground started shaking. The soldiers in the back shouted
                    "GET READY." He gave the note in his hand to the soldier next to him and warned him to get away
                    immediately. After the soldier moved away from among the crowd, he looked back after a while. The
                    ground split, and everyone disappeared into darkness. Seeing this, the soldier whipped his horse to
                    go faster.</p>

                <p>Three hours later, when he arrived at the back headquarters, he gave the note to the officer and
                    added, "The ground split, and they fell inside." Hearing this, the officer called a soldier to his
                    side and sent the soldier with the paper with the note written on it and wanted this to reach the
                    prince urgently.</p>

                <h2 class="chapter-title">Unauthorized Entry</h2>

                <p>Two days later, after the soldier who took the note left the headquarters, the other soldiers were on
                    watch day and night in the protected area. While the officer was wandering at the top of the tower,
                    an explosion happened 100m away. All the soldiers were climbing up to look at the explosion. While
                    the soldier (Zot) who brought the note to the tower was also climbing up, he remembered he had
                    experienced this before. He immediately stopped and started shouting to those above, to those
                    running up past him, "YOU'RE LOOKING IN THE WRONG DIRECTION, THIS IS A DECOY. THE GROUND WILL
                    SPLIT," but no one was listening to him. While the soldier was shouting, the shock wave from the
                    exploded place hit the tower wall. It was so strong that those standing at the top of the tower
                    staggered. This was the first sign. After the shock wave, an arrow came to the tip of the tower.
                    Seeing this, the officer sent one of his soldiers to the arrow while giving the paper with something
                    written on it to another soldier next to him and asked him to set off immediately.</p>

                <p>Five minutes after the soldier left the headquarters with his horse, a voice came from behind saying
                    "I GOT THE ARROW." While Zot was watching what was happening, his mind came together. It's
                    impossible for our people to shoot arrows; they fell into the darkness when the ground collapsed.
                    While thinking these, he was running toward the officer's side. While running, he was shouting "THIS
                    IS A SIGN, DON'T READ IT." Yes, this was a sign, but no one understood. The soldier who climbed to
                    the top looked at the paper and read out loud "THIS IS A TRAP." After reading, the stunned soldier
                    kept looking at the paper and reading it to himself, and he kept reading the same thing. "I guess
                    they sent the wrong message," he said to his officer. Before the officer could answer, the ground
                    started shaking. Just at that moment, Zot had come to the officer's side, but because he was out of
                    breath, the officer left his side and ordered the soldiers to go to alarm status. The tremor got
                    stronger, and a huge gap opened in the ground. While everyone was looking at the gap, flames started
                    rising from the gap. While everyone stepped back 2 steps in fear, things were shooting out from
                    inside the gap. One of the things shooting out fell at Zot's feet. Zot was covered with a strange
                    liquid. He looked at what was on the ground in fear and was shocked. This was a human skeleton. He
                    shouted "THIS IS A HUMAN SKELETON." All the soldiers started rushing around. Just at that moment,
                    flames started coming out of the gap. Before the flames ended, a head appeared, then the body, then
                    the feet, and then its tail, and finally, there was someone coming down from the tail, and he had a
                    5-headed spear in his hand. Everyone was trying to understand whether they were robots or really
                    human and dragon. Just at that moment, the dragon descended on the castle and started burning
                    everywhere. The castle was slowly shattering, and soldiers were dying by burning. While Zot was
                    trying to understand what they were, a legend about the underground that circulated around came to
                    his mind; however, an arrow coming from somewhere he didn't know gave life to that legend. While all
                    this was happening, the human standing by the gap raised his spear, spun it a few times, then
                    stabbed it into the ground, and with the shock wave revealed, all living creatures exploded at the
                    same time. There was no trace left of the tower either. While the dragon was entering the gap, the
                    5-speared human muttered something, held onto the dragon's tail, and disappeared inside the gap.
                    After they left, the gap also closed, and the surroundings were silent as if nothing had happened a
                    moment ago. But only 2 words were circulating in the air. UNAUTHORIZED ENTRY...</p>

                <h2 class="chapter-title">Help Came but... Is That Giant a Robot?</h2>

                <p>The soldiers who were about to faint from exhaustion after being on the road for 2 weeks suddenly
                    came to themselves with a shining orange light, and they were shocked by what they saw. General
                    Plank told the soldiers to immediately get into the robot launchers. (This weapon was designed after
                    the soldiers were given robot power.) As the soldiers entered the weapon, the pilot was launching
                    them, and they were transforming until they reached the giant robot and hitting the giant robot's
                    chest. The first group that went was immediately shattering and exploding because they hit the head.
                    Seeing this, General Plank told the soldiers to go upside down. While looking at the soldiers going,
                    when he raised his head a bit, he saw a turquoise fire flare. When he looked at where the flare came
                    from, he saw someone waving. He took binoculars from a soldier and saw General Şik. Right next to
                    him, he saw General Kipso blowing his horn. He didn't understand why he was blowing, so he looked
                    around and saw soldiers running with cheers from the seashore. Suddenly, a light bulb went on in his
                    head. The pilot told him to go up, and when he looked more carefully from the top, he understood.
                    Generals Kipso and Şik had advanced too far, and now they were on the brink of death. He needed to
                    go to their side immediately. While telling the pilot to land urgently, two helicopters next to him
                    exploded with lasers. The giant robot had gone on the counterattack and started moving. General
                    Plank urgently told the pilot to land. He shot a pink flare into the air. Seeing this, 50
                    helicopters followed the General, and the remaining 30 helicopters started distracting the giant
                    robot.</p>

                <p>When the general made ground contact with the helicopters under his command, the soldiers coming from

                        For the enemy to go on the attack, they have to come from the border on the right side of the
                        forest, and then they'll encounter the giant robot. 3. There's a possibility of the enemy coming
                        from the sea. The plan for that is also ready. From the seashore to 40m behind us, everywhere is
                        covered with mines. If they come from the sea, they'll have to fight us after suffering a lot of

                <p>After Generals Kipso and Şik left General Plank's side, Plank stared after them in amazement. They
                    were going toward the place where robot parts were. General Plank looked up and tried to explain
                    what happened to General Şonft with hand signals. While summarizing the situation, the moment he got
                    on the plane, thousands of locks were heard, and the ground started shaking. When General Plank
                    turned around, his eyes opened, and he couldn't believe what he saw. The robot standing in the
                    direction where Generals Şik and Kipso went had combined and was trying to stand up. There was
                    something strange about the robot. Its left hand was a bit bigger than its right hand, and on its
                    head, there was something resembling a bullet club. Also, although the robot was thin, it seemed a
                    bit taller compared to the robot in front of it. The robot finally stood up. After taking 5 steps,
                    it staggered and fell to the ground. One hand was on the ground, the other hand was on its knee, and
                    the bullet club on its head was turned toward the enemy in front of it.</p>

                <p>When General Plank turned his head back to the giant robot, the robot had started moving and was
                    trying to get out of the forested area. The small robot where Generals Kipso and Şik combined with
                    the other soldiers had also started shooting at the giant robot at that moment. The small robot's
                    shots were damaging the giant robot. Everyone was seeing this, but the robot continued advancing.
                    Suddenly, small parts started flying into the air from the small robot, then those broken parts
                    turned into small flying creatures and started advancing toward the giant robot. They landed on the
                    giant robot's chest and started damaging it. The giant robot was advancing without stopping; at this
                    rate, in 2-3 hours, it would have crushed or killed them with its laser. The giant robot suddenly
                    started staggering because the 1-2 creatures sent by the small robot where Generals Kipso and Şik
                    combined with other soldiers had attacked its knee. This slowed it down a bit, but it didn't
                    completely stop it. Then suddenly, the air darkened, and the ground started shaking. General Kipso's
                    powers had started working on the ground. The ground in front of them collapsed. Two 20m dinosaurs
                    came out from below. One was flying. These were enough to bring down the huge robot, and in fact,
                    they would help their progress. The dinosaurs started attacking the giant robot. One was trying to
                    damage one leg, and the other was trying to damage the body. While they were trying to damage the
                    robot, the small robot where Generals Kipso and Şik combined with other soldiers was also shooting.
                    The robot had come out of the forested area now. It was a bit more comfortable, but some of its
                    parts were falling off one by one due to the incoming attacks. Its right arm had broken off; there
                    was now a huge hole in its left leg; it was a matter of time before it fell to the ground. But while
                    everyone was looking at the robot, something happened. While the giant robot's other arm was falling
                    to the ground, the air suddenly darkened, and 2 orange lightning struck behind the forested area.
